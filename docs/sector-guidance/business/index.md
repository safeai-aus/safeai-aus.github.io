# Business & Industry

> **Purpose:** Make the strategic AI decisions that cannot be delegated to a provider<br>
> **Audience:** Australian boards, executives, risk, security and technology leaders | **Time:** 15–20 minutes

This page focuses on strategic preparedness for advanced AI systems and possible AGI. It complements—not replaces—current AI governance, legal obligations and operational risk management.

## Where business responsibility begins

Most Australian organisations will encounter advanced AI as customers, not developers. A system may arrive through a familiar vendor and quickly become embedded in decisions, workflows and critical services. The provider can describe the product, but it cannot decide the organisation's risk appetite, accept accountability for its use or preserve the organisation's ability to operate without it.

That places the greatest direct weight on [Governance](../../preparing-for-agi/framework/governance.md) and [Resilience](../../preparing-for-agi/framework/resilience.md): who decides, what reaches the board, which dependencies are acceptable and whether essential functions can continue. [Containment](../../preparing-for-agi/framework/containment.md) matters at the deployment boundary—where an organisation can refuse, restrict, isolate or withdraw a system. [Alignment](../../preparing-for-agi/framework/alignment.md) is practical and contextual: does the system reliably serve the organisation, its customers, workers and the public interest under real operating conditions?

!!! info "The decision stays with the organisation"

    The question is not whether every AGI forecast is correct. It is whether the organisation can make and reverse high-consequence decisions under substantial uncertainty.

## Five decisions a vendor cannot make for you

### 1. Where are your deployment red lines?

Define indicators that trigger stronger controls before a procurement or deployment decision becomes urgent. Relevant indicators may include:

- autonomous action in consequential functions;
- control of a critical operational path;
- authority to commit funds, alter infrastructure or make difficult-to-reverse decisions;
- reasoning or behaviour that cannot be adequately evaluated;
- access to sensitive systems, data or tools; and
- dependence shared across an industry or supply chain.

Use graduated decision thresholds rather than one approval process for every system.

| Deployment context | Suggested decision level | Evidence before deployment |
|---|---|---|
| Internal productivity support | Accountable business owner | Purpose, data handling, testing, logging and a clear owner |
| High-impact recommendations affecting people or material interests | Executive risk owner | Human decision authority, documented evaluation, audit trail and appeal or correction path |
| Control of critical operations or infrastructure | Board-level approval with independent challenge | Stress testing, safe shutdown, tested fallback, incident response and continuing assurance |
| Autonomous strategic or irreversible action | Presumption against deployment | A compelling case, explicit risk acceptance and controls proportionate to the potential consequences |

Thresholds should be reviewed as capabilities, system access and organisational dependence change.

### 2. Which dependencies could you not replace?

Map more than vendor names. For each important system, record:

- provider and underlying model family;
- business functions and downstream services that depend on it;
- data, integrations and workflows that may be difficult to move;
- who controls model updates and material behaviour changes;
- time needed to switch, isolate or operate without it; and
- whether competitors and suppliers depend on the same provider.

A local or open model can reduce some external dependencies, but it also transfers security, maintenance, evaluation and skills responsibilities to the organisation. Cloud, dedicated-hosting, local and hybrid arrangements should therefore be treated as risk choices—not ideological defaults.

For critical functions, favour portability, access to your own data and logs, notice of material changes and a credible exit path. Where local deployment is proportionate, use it to preserve control or continuity rather than to follow a technology trend.

Critical-infrastructure operators should also consider whether AI providers, data flows and failure modes belong within any [Critical Infrastructure Risk Management Program](https://www.cisc.gov.au/how-we-support-industry/regulatory-obligations) that applies under the *Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018*. Obligations vary by asset and entity; local deployment does not by itself demonstrate compliance.

### 3. Can you operate if the AI is unavailable or untrusted?

Documentation alone is not a fallback. Staff need the authority, information and practice required to operate without AI assistance.

!!! tip "Run a practical resilience drill"

    1. Select one AI-dependent critical function.
    2. Simulate the system, vendor or model being unavailable or untrusted.
    3. Operate through the fallback for a meaningful period.
    4. Record what stopped, slowed or became unsafe.
    5. Update procedures, training, data access and decision authority.

Test whether people can recognise when to switch modes. A fallback that activates only after a total outage may not help when a system continues operating but its outputs become unreliable.

### 4. What happens when failures affect the whole sector?

Advanced AI can create correlated risk when organisations use the same providers, model families, integration patterns or data sources. A defect, security incident, provider decision or geopolitical restriction can then affect many organisations at once.

Work through industry associations, information-sharing mechanisms and regulators to:

- identify shared dependencies and single points of failure;
- share appropriately protected incident and evaluation information;
- exercise sector-wide disruption scenarios;
- coordinate minimum expectations for vendors; and
- avoid treating a widely used system as safe merely because it is widely used.

Procurement is also a safety lever. Large customers can require evaluation evidence, incident notification, change control, portability, audit access and tested shutdown arrangements. Coordinated demand makes these properties commercially important to providers.

### 5. How will you position for different futures?

Do not build strategy around one date or one capability forecast. Test plans against differences in:

- the pace of capability improvement;
- the effectiveness of governance and technical safeguards;
- the concentration or distribution of provider power; and
- the severity of disruption, misuse or public backlash.

Prioritise capabilities that remain useful across several futures: evaluation expertise, clear decision rights, vendor independence, workforce knowledge, manual fallbacks and relationships with government and industry peers.

Advanced-AI preparedness is also a workforce capability question. Involve affected workers and, where relevant, unions or workplace delegates before decisions become difficult to reverse. They can identify hidden work, unsafe workarounds and skills that an executive or vendor assessment may miss. [Workplace consultation requirements](https://www.fairwork.gov.au/tools-and-resources/best-practice-guides/consultation-and-cooperation-in-the-workplace) may also apply to significant technological change; organisations should check the award or agreement covering their workforce.

This is a hedging strategy. It preserves options without assuming that AGI is imminent or that current systems will follow a single development path.

## Scenarios to exercise

Use the [SafeAI-Aus scenarios](../../preparing-for-agi/scenarios/index.md) as planning tools. Select scenarios that expose your most important assumptions rather than those that seem most likely.

| Scenario | Business questions to test |
|---|---|
| **[Power Concentration & Governance Failure](../../preparing-for-agi/scenarios/scenario-power-concentration.md)** | Which decisions have effectively been transferred to providers? What bargaining power or exit options remain? |
| **[Gradual Disempowerment](../../preparing-for-agi/scenarios/scenario-gradual-disempowerment.md)** | Are people retaining the authority and skills to challenge or replace automated decisions? |
| **[Critical Infrastructure](../../preparing-for-agi/scenarios/scenario-critical-infrastructure.md)** | Where can failures cascade across operations, suppliers and essential services? |
| **[Information Ecosystems](../../preparing-for-agi/scenarios/scenario-information-ecosystems.md)** | How would synthetic content, fraud or loss of trust affect customers, staff and crisis communication? |
| **[Catastrophic Misuse](../../preparing-for-agi/scenarios/scenario-catastrophic-misuse.md)** | Could your systems, research, access or supply chain enable high-consequence misuse? |
| **[Loss of Control](../../preparing-for-agi/scenarios/scenario-loss-of-control.md)** | Which deployments would become difficult to supervise or shut down once embedded in critical operations? |

Record the decisions the exercise changes: a scenario discussion that produces no owner, threshold, investment or follow-up is unlikely to improve preparedness.

## Questions for your next planning discussion

!!! question "Use these prompts to explore your organisation's position"
    - Which AI-enabled functions are critical, difficult to reverse or heavily dependent on one provider?

    - Who currently owns the related risk decisions and what authority do they have to review, restrict or stop a deployment?

    - What evidence, incident or provider change would prompt the organisation to reconsider how a system is used?

    - Could an important function continue if an AI service remained available but its outputs could not be trusted?

    - Which scenario would best expose assumptions about customers, workers, suppliers or sector-wide dependencies?
