# Business & Industry

## Who this is for

Australian business and industry: boards, executives, risk/security/technology leaders, industry associations, critical infrastructure operators, defence contractors.

## The challenge

Advanced AI systems are being deployed across Australian business—in critical infrastructure, financial services, healthcare, platforms, and supply chains. These systems offer significant benefits but also create new risks.

**Key realities:**

- You're deploying systems you didn't develop
- Market pressure pushes adoption faster than evaluation
- Failures cascade—your AI risks become systemic risks
- Vendor lock-in creates dependencies that are hard to reverse
- Australia is a net importer of frontier AI with limited domestic evaluation capability

**Key insight:** Business isn't just regulated—it's a critical partner in managing systemic risk. Your AI deployment decisions affect entire sectors and communities.

## Setting the "Demand Signal" for Safety

Government regulation is often too slow to keep pace with AI progress. **Business has a unique and powerful role: acting as the primary customer for safety.**

In an environment where AI companies are racing to ship capabilities, they will prioritise what their biggest customers demand.

*   **Passive Compliance:** "We will follow whatever safety rules the government sets." (Too slow).
*   **Active Demand Signal:** "We will NOT buy your model unless you can prove it meets specific safety evaluations (e.g. inability to self-replicate, data leakage guarantees)."

By collectively demanding verifiable safety features, Australian industry creates a commercial incentive for AI labs to prioritise safety, effectively "voting with your wallet" for a safer ecosystem.

## How sectors work together

Business doesn't operate in isolation when managing AI risks:

**Government sets the regulatory environment** through [licensing requirements, procurement standards and coordination mechanisms](../government-policy/index.md). Understanding [government policy directions](../government-policy/ai-safety-policy.md) helps businesses anticipate requirements and shape strategy proactively rather than reactively.

**Business decisions have community impacts:** Your AI deployment choices affect local employment, service access and community resilience. [Community preparedness](../communities-households/community-preparedness.md) depends partly on whether businesses maintain manual operation capability and share information during disruptions.

**Communities provide early warning:** Strong [community networks](../communities-households/index.md) can signal when AI systems aren't working as intended—before problems become crises. Community input helps businesses understand local context and avoid alignment failures.

**Key insight:** Your strategic planning should account for [government regulatory trajectory](../government-policy/index.md) and [community resilience dependencies](../communities-households/index.md). Understanding the full ecosystem makes for better risk management.

## Strategic AI landscape

Australian businesses face a critical gap: widespread adoption of current AI tools (chatbots, analytics, automation) without strategic preparation for advanced AI systems with unprecedented capabilities.

Over the next 5-30 years, AI systems may achieve or exceed human-level performance across domains critical to business: strategic planning, R&D, complex decision-making, negotiation. Some scenarios involve rapid capability gains that could fundamentally reshape industries within months.

The C·A·G·R framework helps businesses think beyond operational AI governance (day-to-day vendor management, current compliance) to strategic positioning: How does your organisation prepare for AI systems that could automate executive functions? What happens to your competitive position if AI capabilities concentrate in a few global actors? Can your organisation function if AI-mediated services fail during critical periods?

Most boards aren't yet thinking about advanced AI risks. This creates strategic vulnerability—organisations that wait for AGI to arrive before preparing may find themselves unable to adapt quickly enough.

## Business role through C·A·G·R

### :lucide-shield-ban: Containment

**Strategic decisions about adopting highly capable AI systems before their full implications are understood.**

As AI systems approach human-level capabilities in critical business domains (financial strategy, legal analysis, R&D), containment means asking: Should we deploy this capability at all? What safeguards prevent over-dependence on systems we can't fully evaluate? How do we maintain the option to not use advanced AI if risks are unacceptable?

**Key actions:**

- Define red lines for deployment based on capability thresholds
- Don't deploy autonomous systems in critical functions without proper evaluation
- Maintain ability to shut down and roll back systems
- Reduce vendor dependencies that create single points of failure

### :lucide-target: Alignment

**Ensuring advanced AI systems deployed in your organisation pursue objectives aligned with business survival and stakeholder wellbeing.**

Current AI systems can be misaligned through poor training or incentives. Advanced AI systems could pursue objectives that appear beneficial initially but diverge dangerously at scale. Your responsibility is ensuring systems remain aligned even as capabilities increase dramatically.

**Key actions:**

- Test systems under adversarial and edge-case conditions
- Monitor for unexpected behaviours in production
- Plan for correlated failures across your sector
- Maintain manual capability when AI systems fail

[Strategic guidance →](agi-preparedness-strategy.md)

### :lucide-scale: Governance

**Building organisational capacity to make strategic decisions about advanced AI under uncertainty.**

Governance for AGI isn't just compliance with emerging regulations—it's developing institutional capability to assess unprecedented risks, make decisions when expert consensus is uncertain, and adapt quickly as capabilities evolve. This includes board-level understanding of AI trajectory and escalation procedures for advanced system concerns.

**Key actions:**

- Understand regulatory obligations
- Report significant AI failures to authorities
- Provide transparency to regulators and stakeholders
- Engage constructively in policy development

### :lucide-shield: Resilience

**Ensuring business continuity when AI capabilities you depend on fail, are disrupted, or are weaponised.**

Advanced AI creates new resilience challenges: supply chain disruption through AI-enabled attacks, dependence on AI-mediated services that could fail or be denied, workforce skills atrophy if automation is extensive. Resilience means maintaining organisational capability to function when advanced AI systems are unavailable or adversarial.

**Key actions:**

- Plan for AI system failures
- Maintain manual fallbacks for critical functions
- Map AI dependencies in operations and supply chain
- Use scenario planning and tabletop exercises

!!! note "Strategic vs Operational AI Governance"

    The **[Advanced AI & AGI](/agi-tomorrow-index/)** section focuses on strategic positioning for AI systems with unprecedented capabilities over a 5-30 year horizon. This includes scenario planning for rapid capability gains, board-level AGI risk literacy, and organisational resilience to transformational AI impacts.

    For **operational AI governance**—managing current AI systems, vendor evaluation, compliance with today's standards—see the **[AI Standards & Legislation](/safety-standards/)**, **[Governance Templates](/governance-templates/policy-template-library/)**, and **[Business Resources](/business-resources/)** sections.

    Most businesses need both: operational governance for day-to-day AI adoption, and strategic preparation for advanced AI transformation.
