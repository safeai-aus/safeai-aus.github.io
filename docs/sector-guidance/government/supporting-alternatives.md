# Supporting Decentralised Alternatives

## Why government should support alternatives

**Resilience:** Distributed systems are less vulnerable to disruption than centralised platforms. When critical services depend on single providers, any failure—technical, commercial, or geopolitical—creates systemic risk.

**Competition:** Alternatives create accountability for centralised providers. When users can exit to community-owned services, platforms must serve user interests or lose them. Competition prevents monopoly capture.

**Democratic values:** Community ownership aligns with democratic governance. Member-controlled cooperatives enable genuine participation in decisions about transformative technology, not just consultation.

**Sovereignty:** Local capability reduces foreign dependence. When critical AI infrastructure is controlled overseas, Australia's ability to govern AI use is constrained by foreign corporate and government decisions.

!!! tip "Key insight"

    Supporting alternatives isn't anti-innovation—it's preventing monopoly capture. Competitive markets require viable alternatives. Government support creates conditions for competition, not picking winners.

!!! success "What this achieves"

    **Resilience:** Distributed systems reduce single-point-of-failure risk
    **Competition:** Alternatives create accountability for centralised providers
    **Democratic values:** Community ownership enables genuine participation
    **Sovereignty:** Local capability reduces foreign dependence

## Strategic procurement

### Current reality: Government procurement favours Big Tech

**Why incumbents win:**

- Economies of scale drive lower unit prices
- "Nobody gets fired for buying Microsoft" culture
- Procurement rules favour established vendors with track records
- Complex compliance requirements create barriers to entry
- Risk aversion favours known quantities over alternatives

**Result:** Public sector spending reinforces concentration, making alternative providers increasingly unviable.

### Alternative approach: Procurement that supports competition

**Reserve portion of procurement for cooperatives/community providers:**

- Set-asides for social enterprises and cooperatives (similar to small business programs)
- Dedicated budget for piloting alternative providers
- Multi-year commitments enable cooperative capital formation
- Clear pathways for community providers to bid

**Evaluate on total cost of ownership (including lock-in risk):**

- Factor in vendor lock-in costs and exit barriers
- Consider data sovereignty and security risks
- Account for community benefit and local capability building
- Long-term resilience value, not just immediate price

**Consider social value:**

- Local jobs and capability development
- Democratic governance and community accountability
- Data sovereignty and privacy protection
- Contribution to resilient infrastructure

**Regional cooperation for shared procurement:**

- Coordinate with other jurisdictions for scale
- Shared evaluation and compliance processes
- Bulk purchasing power for community providers
- Reduce duplication across governments

### International examples

**Barcelona's open-source city strategy:**

- Municipal services built on open-source platforms
- Data sovereignty and citizen control priorities
- Local technology cooperatives supported through procurement
- Digital commons approach to technology

**French government support for cooperative platforms:**

- Tax incentives for cooperative business models
- Procurement preferences for social enterprises
- Public investment in cooperative digital infrastructure
- ESS (social and solidarity economy) integration

**Italian social cooperative procurement preferences:**

- Legal framework for social cooperative procurement
- Reserved contracts for specific service types
- Multi-stakeholder cooperative models
- Integration with employment and social policy

### Practical implementation

Government procurement transformation doesn't require revolution—it requires deliberate, staged implementation that reduces risk while building new capability.

!!! tip "Start small, scale what works"

    Don't mandate cooperatives across all procurement immediately. Begin with low-risk pilots, learn from experience, then scale successful approaches. Failure in pilot programs is acceptable; failure in critical infrastructure is not.

**Start with non-critical services (learning before scaling):**

- Pilot programs in low-risk domains — test procurement approaches where failure is manageable
- Build capability before critical deployments — government and cooperatives both need to learn
- Learn from early implementations — honest evaluation of what works and what doesn't
- Scale what works, adapt what doesn't — evidence-based expansion

**Provide technical assistance to cooperative bidders:**

- Help navigate procurement processes — complexity shouldn't be barrier to entry
- Support compliance with requirements — cooperatives may lack procurement expertise
- Build capacity for tendering — investment in alternative providers
- Reduce barriers to participation — level the playing field

**Longer contract terms to allow cooperative capital formation:**

- Multi-year agreements enable planning and investment — cooperatives can invest confidently
- Predictable revenue supports cooperative sustainability — business case requires stability
- Time to build capability and demonstrate value — rushing leads to failure
- Reduce constant re-tendering overhead — efficiency for both government and providers

**Staged procurement (pilot → scale):**

- Small initial contracts to prove viability — low-risk testing
- Scale based on demonstrated performance — evidence drives expansion
- Learning cycles between stages — improve approach iteratively
- Risk reduction through phasing — prudent governance

## Common questions

These questions commonly arise when government considers supporting decentralised alternatives. The answers require understanding both short-term trade-offs and long-term strategic value.

!!! question "Won't this create inefficiency?"

    **Short term:** Possibly higher costs for some services while alternative providers build capability and scale.

    **Long term:** Competition and innovation from alternatives improve overall efficiency. Total cost accounting (including lock-in risk, sovereignty value) often favours alternatives.

    **Strategic consideration:** Not all services need maximum centralised efficiency. Resilience, sovereignty, and democratic control have value beyond immediate cost minimisation. A slightly more expensive service that can't be shut down by foreign corporate decision may be better value strategically.

!!! question "Can cooperatives really compete?"

    **In some domains, yes:**

    - Privacy and data sovereignty (local deployment advantage)
    - Local customisation (community control enables adaptation)
    - Trust and accountability (democratic governance, member oversight)
    - Services where values matter more than scale

    **In others, no:**

    - Bleeding-edge frontier research (requires massive capital)
    - Services requiring global scale economies
    - Domains where network effects are overwhelming

    **Government role:** Level the playing field without picking winners. Support enables competition; market determines outcomes. The goal isn't replacing all Big Tech with cooperatives—it's ensuring alternatives exist so users have genuine choice.

!!! question "Isn't this anti-business?"

    **No—cooperatives ARE businesses:**

    - Member-owned enterprises operating in competitive markets
    - Entrepreneurial, innovative, create jobs and economic activity
    - Generate tax revenue like any business
    - Difference is ownership structure, not market participation

    **Supports small/medium business vs. monopoly:**

    - Prevents platform extraction from SMEs
    - Enables collective action against market power
    - Cooperative ownership is business ownership (by members)
    - Democratic capitalism, not state socialism

    **Creates competitive market rather than extractive platforms:**

    - Competition serves public interest
    - Prevents monopoly capture
    - Innovation through diverse approaches
    - Economic dynamism from viable alternatives
