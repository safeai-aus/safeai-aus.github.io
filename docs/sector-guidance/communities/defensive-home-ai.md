# Defensive Home AI


---

## Overview

**Defensive Home AI** is about managing dependence on AI systems, maintaining privacy, and building household digital resilience. It's not about avoiding technology—it's about making conscious choices that protect your agency and capability.

**Key principles:**

- Use AI tools that serve you, not extract from you
- Keep sensitive data local where possible
- Maintain backup methods that don't depend on platforms or internet
- Build skills for information verification and critical media literacy
- Support community-serving over extractive technology

## Local AI options

Running AI on your own devices keeps your data private and gives you control. Several accessible options exist for households without technical expertise.

### Why local AI matters

**Prevents surveillance capability:**

- **Your conversations never leave your device** — prevents centralised AI systems from building detailed profiles of your thinking, questions, concerns, and behaviour
- **No data harvesting** — companies can't train AI models on your interactions or sell insights about you
- **Not subject to platform monitoring** — authorities or companies can't access your AI usage data through legal requests or data breaches
- **Reduces concentration of information power** — prevents a handful of companies from knowing what millions of households are thinking and doing

This isn't abstract privacy concern — it's defense against the [surveillance and information control scenarios](../agi-scenarios/scenario-information-ecosystems.md) and [power concentration risks](../agi-scenarios/scenario-power-concentration.md) that centralised AI enables.

**Resilience:**

- Works without internet connection
- Can't be shut down by companies
- No subscription fees or usage limits

**Agency:**

- You control what models you use
- Not subject to changing terms of service
- Teaches digital literacy and conscious technology choices

### Accessible local AI tools

| **Tool** | **Best for** | **Requirements** | **Setup difficulty** |
|----------|--------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **[Ollama](https://ollama.com/)** | Most households | 8GB+ RAM, 10GB disk | Easy - command line |
| **[LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)** | Non-technical users | 8GB+ RAM, 10GB disk | Easiest - graphical interface |
| **[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)** | Smart home users | Dedicated device or server | Moderate - technical setup |

**For detailed setup instructions**, visit vendor websites or [Privacy Guides](https://www.privacyguides.org/) for comprehensive tutorials.

## Privacy-preserving alternatives

### Strategic approach to digital sovereignty

Rather than replacing everything at once, strategically shift key services to privacy-respecting alternatives:

| **Service type** | **Big Tech default** | **Privacy alternative** | **Key benefit** |
|------------------|---------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| **Messaging** | WhatsApp, Messenger | [Signal](https://signal.org/) | End-to-end encrypted, open-source |
| **Search** | Google Search | DuckDuckGo, Brave Search | No tracking or profiling |
| **Browser** | Chrome, Safari | Firefox, Brave | Privacy-respecting, ad-blocking |
| **Email** | Gmail, Outlook | [Proton Mail](https://proton.me/) | Encrypted, Swiss privacy laws |
| **File sync** | Google Drive, Dropbox | [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) | Device-to-device, no cloud |

**Why this matters for AI resilience:** Reduces data flowing to companies training AI models, maintains backup communication when platforms fail, builds household digital sovereignty.

## Information verification toolkit

As AI-generated content becomes indistinguishable from real, verification skills are essential.

### Basic verification techniques

**1. Check multiple sources**

Before believing or sharing information:

- Search for the same story from different outlets
- Check major Australian news sources (ABC, SBS, major newspapers)
- Be skeptical of single-source stories

**Practice:** See a surprising social media post? Search for the topic in reliable news. If only unreliable sources cover it, be very skeptical.

**2. Reverse image search**

Images can be manipulated or taken out of context.

**How to do it:**
1. Right-click image → "Search image with Google" (Chrome), OR
2. Visit [images.google.com](https://images.google.com/) → Camera icon → Upload image, OR
3. Use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) for reverse image search

**What to look for:**

- When was image first used?
- Is it from a different event/time/place?
- Has it been edited or manipulated?

**3. Check dates and context**

Old content is often recirculated as if current:
- Check publication dates on articles
- Look for clues in content (weather, clothing, signs, technology)
- Verify the timing matches claims

**4. Consider the source**

**Ask:**

- Who published this?
- What's their track record?
- What's their motivation?

**Trusted Australian sources:**

- ABC News, SBS News (public broadcasters)
- Major newspapers (check multiple for balance)
- Academic institutions and research organisations
- Government agencies (for official information)

**Red flags:**

- Anonymous or obscure sources
- Extreme emotional language
- Claims of "what they don't want you to know"
- No byline or contact information

### Tools for verification

**Fact-checking organisations:**

- [RMIT ABC Fact Check](https://www.abc.net.au/news/factcheck/) — Australian fact-checking
- [AAP FactCheck](https://www.aap.com.au/factcheck/) — Australian Associated Press

**AI-generated content detection:**

- [Hive Moderation](https://hivemoderation.com/ai-generated-content-detection) — Detects AI images
- [Optic AI or Not](https://www.optic.xyz/ai-or-not) — Check if image is AI-generated

!!! warning "Detection tools have limitations"

    Detection tools aren't perfect and will become less reliable as AI improves. Best approach: combine tools with critical thinking and source verification.

### Household verification practices

**Create family agreements:**

- Check before sharing: "If it's surprising, verify it first"
- Discuss questionable content: "Does this seem credible?"
- Teach kids verification skills: Make it a game
- Have trusted sources list: Where do we go for reliable info?

**During crises or emergencies:**

- Verify official information through multiple channels
- Don't spread unverified claims (even if trying to help)
- Use established communication methods (ABC Radio, official government sites)
- Be especially skeptical of dramatic claims

**Practice together:**

- Weekly: Find a news story and verify it together
- Teach kids: How to check sources and reverse image search
- Family discussions: What would we do if we weren't sure what's real during an emergency?

## Household resilience exercises

### Exercise 1: Map your AI dependencies

**Time:** 30 minutes | **Who:** Whole household

**What to do:**

1. List AI systems you use:
   - Streaming recommendations (Netflix, Spotify)
   - Voice assistants (Alexa, Siri, Google Home)
   - Social media feeds
   - Government services (myGov, Centrelink)

2. For each system, ask:
   - What does it do for us?
   - What would we do if it stopped working?
   - Do we have alternatives?

3. Identify where you want to reduce dependence

**Follow-up:** Pick 1-2 systems to develop alternatives for

### Exercise 2: Communication backup plan

**Time:** 1 hour | **Who:** Whole household + close contacts

**What to do:**

1. List critical contacts (family, friends, neighbours, schools)
2. Current methods: How do we usually contact them?
3. Create backups:
   - Phone numbers (call, not just text)
   - Printed contact list
   - Designated meeting places
   - Signal group for close contacts

4. Test it: Actually use backup method once

**Refresh:** Review and test quarterly

### Exercise 3: Information crisis simulation

**Time:** 30 minutes | **Who:** Teenagers and adults

**Scenario:** "Major local incident with conflicting information on social media, some clearly fake. You need to figure out what's real."

**Discuss:**

- Where would we get reliable information?
- How would we verify social media content?
- How would we know what's real?

**Create plan:**

- List trusted sources (ABC Radio, emergency apps, council)
- Set up official emergency apps now
- Know what official channels look like before you need them

### Exercise 4: Platform alternatives experiment

**Time:** 1 month experiment

**Pick one Big Tech dependency to replace:**

- Use Signal instead of WhatsApp for family chat
- Try DuckDuckGo instead of Google for a week
- Switch from Google Drive to Syncthing for file sharing

**Track:** What worked? What was difficult? Do we want to keep the change?

**Goal:** Not necessarily to quit everything, but to know you can and practice choosing consciously.

## Common questions

### Do I need to give up all convenient AI services?

No. The goal is conscious choice and resilience, not total avoidance. Use AI services that genuinely help you, but:

- Understand what data you're trading for convenience
- Have alternatives for critical functions
- Don't become completely dependent on any single platform

### Isn't this a lot of work?

Start small. Even one or two changes improve your resilience:

- Just using Signal for close contacts helps
- Just having printed contact list helps
- Just practicing information verification helps

### What if I'm not technical?

Most tools here don't require technical skills:

- Signal is as easy as WhatsApp
- DuckDuckGo works exactly like Google
- LM Studio has friendly interface

Start with easiest changes first. Learn as you go.

### How do I teach kids about this?

**Make it practical, not preachy:**

- Teach verification as a game: "Can you find where this image really comes from?"
- Explain privacy simply: "These companies make money from knowing about you"
- Practice backup methods: "What if internet was down during emergency?"

**Age-appropriate:**

- Young kids: Basic digital literacy and privacy
- Teenagers: Verification skills, platform alternatives
- Young adults: Full privacy toolkit and resilience practices
