# Community AI Infrastructure


---

## Overview

Communities don't have to be passive consumers of Big Tech AI. This page shows how communities can run their own AI services, communication systems, and digital infrastructure—keeping power, data, and benefits local.

**Key concepts:**

- **Community-run AI servers** — shared AI resources owned by community
- **Local-first communication** — systems that work without external platforms
- **Digital resilience hubs** — community spaces with local tech infrastructure
- **Skill-building programs** — building community capacity

**Why this matters:**

- Keeps data and power in community hands
- Builds resilience to platform failures or manipulation
- Strengthens local economy and capability
- Creates alternatives to extractive platform business models

## Community-run AI servers

Communities can pool resources to run AI services for members—more capable than home setups, more private than Big Tech platforms.

### What community AI can provide

| **Service type** | **What it offers** | **Who benefits** |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Local AI assistant** | Web/mobile access to AI that stays in Australia | Students, community orgs, seniors, local businesses |
| **Information verification** | Fact-checking, image/video verification, AI content detection | Everyone—especially during information crises |
| **Accessibility services** | Transcription, translation, accessible interfaces | People with disabilities, migrants, seniors |
| **Digital literacy** | Teaching tool that respects privacy | Schools, libraries, community education programs |

**Key advantages:** Data sovereignty, no corporate surveillance, customizable for local context, resilient to platform shutdowns.

### Who can run community AI

**Potential operators:**

- Local councils (digital infrastructure like roads and utilities)
- Libraries (public access to technology and knowledge)
- Community centres and neighbourhood houses
- Schools and TAFEs
- Community tech cooperatives (member-owned)
- Local hackerspaces or maker spaces

### Governance and sustainability

=== "Council-owned"

    **Public infrastructure model**

    - Owned and operated by local government
    - Funded through rates or grants
    - Free access for residents
    - Like public libraries or community centres

    **Funding:** $10k-$50k setup, $8k-$60k/year ongoing

=== "Cooperative"

    **Member-owned model**

    - Community members buy shares or memberships
    - Democratic governance (one member, one vote)
    - Reinvest surplus into improving service
    - Like credit unions or housing cooperatives

    **Funding:** Member fees (sliding scale), grants, crowdfunding

=== "Non-profit"

    **Community organisation model**

    - Community org runs service for public benefit
    - Funded by grants, donations, some user fees
    - Governed by board representing community
    - Like neighborhood houses or community centres

    **Funding:** Grants, donations, volunteer labour, partnerships

**Cost comparison:** Per-user cost can be much lower than commercial AI subscriptions at scale.

**For technical guides:** [Ollama documentation](https://ollama.com/) or contact community tech organisations in resources section.

### Privacy and community control

**Key principles:**

- Minimal data collection, no tracking or profiling
- Community control over what data is collected
- No selling or sharing data
- Transparent about data use
- Regular privacy audits
- Community oversight and input

---

## Local-first communication systems

Community communication that doesn't depend on corporate platforms.

### Why local-first matters

**Vulnerabilities of platform dependence:**

- Facebook groups can be shut down or manipulated by algorithms
- Platform terms can change, locking communities out
- During crises, platforms may be unreliable or compromised
- Corporate interests don't align with community needs

**Local-first alternative:**

- Community controls infrastructure
- Resilient to platform failures
- Works during internet disruptions
- Serves community, not advertisers

### Practical options for communities

| **Infrastructure type** | **What it provides** | **Resilience level** | **Resources** |
|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Mesh networks** | Community-owned wireless network | Works without internet | [LibreMesh](https://libremesh.org/), [Freifunk](https://freifunk.net/) |
| **Community servers** | Nextcloud (files), Matrix (chat), Mastodon (social) | Can't be shut down by corporations | Self-host or community tech coop |
| **Peer-to-peer tools** | Briar (encrypted messaging via Bluetooth/WiFi) | Works without internet or platforms | [Briar](https://briarproject.org/) |
| **Community radio** | Low-tech broadcast | Essential during major emergencies | Local community radio stations |
| **Phone trees** | Printed contact lists | Works without any technology | Template in preparedness guides |

**Hybrid approach (recommended):** Use platform tools for broad reach, local tools for coordination, offline tools for resilience—ready to switch when needed.

- Public access to technology
- Community tech support
- Organising space for local groups

### Who can host hubs?

**Existing infrastructure:**

- Libraries (already have computers, internet, community role)
- Community centres and neighbourhood houses
- Schools and TAFEs (outside school hours)
- Council buildings

**What they need:**

- Meeting spaces for training
- Computer equipment for public access
- Server infrastructure for community AI/services
- Backup power for emergency operations
- Backup internet connectivity
- Staffing: Community tech coordinators (paid or volunteer)

### Example: Library as digital resilience hub

**Enhanced for resilience:**

- Community AI server for patrons
- Mesh network node
- Emergency power and communications

## Real-world examples

**Community mesh networks in rural Australia:**

Some rural communities have built mesh networks providing internet access during bushfire emergencies when telecommunications failed. Residents can communicate locally even without internet connectivity, proving critical for coordination and safety.

**Libraries as tech hubs:**

Progressive libraries worldwide are evolving beyond book lending to provide community technology access, digital literacy programs, and maker spaces. Australian libraries well-positioned to extend this to AI resilience and community-owned infrastructure.

**Community tech cooperatives:**

Member-owned cooperatives provide technology services as alternative to extractive Big Tech platforms. Models exist internationally (e.g., Platform Cooperatives) that could be adapted to Australian context for AI infrastructure.

## Common questions

### Isn't this too technical for most communities?

Not necessarily. While technical skills help, many communities successfully run infrastructure with:

- Mix of technical and non-technical people
- Training and mentorship from experienced organisations
- Starting small and learning as you go
- Partnerships with councils, libraries, or tech cooperatives

The hardest part is often community organising, not technology.

### How is this better than just using Big Tech services?

**Community infrastructure offers:**

- Data sovereignty and privacy
- Resilience to platform failures
- Community control over services
- Economic benefits staying local
- Building community capacity
- Alternatives during emergencies

**Trade-off:** Requires community investment and maintenance. Worth it for critical infrastructure and services.

### Can this scale?

Yes. Start small (one hub, one neighbourhood), use federation model so communities can network while maintaining independence. Many successful community networks worldwide serve thousands of users.


### What if our community doesn't have funding?

**Start minimal:**

- Use volunteer labour and donated equipment
- Partner with existing infrastructure (libraries, schools)
- Start with software-only solutions (mesh networking, free software)
- Demonstrate value, attract funding as you grow

---

## Economic sustainability and governance

Community infrastructure requires funding and democratic decision-making to succeed long-term.

### Making it sustainable

**Funding approaches:**

- Member contributions (monthly fees, equity shares)
- Service revenue (premium tiers, business services)
- Grants and government support

**Example costs (100 households):**

- Hardware: $50k amortised = $10k/year
- Operating: $5k/year (power, hosting, maintenance)
- Total: ~$12-15/month per household

**Value proposition:** Modest cost with privacy, local control, and democratic governance vs. "free" Big Tech services with data extraction.

### Democratic control

**What needs governance:**

- Which services to provide
- Investment priorities
- Privacy and acceptable use policies
- Resource allocation

**Governance models:**

- Direct democracy (all members vote)
- Representative (elected board)
- Multi-stakeholder (users, volunteers, organisations)

### Getting started

Building community infrastructure requires planning, coordination, and commitment.
