## Local organising strategies

### Why community organising matters

!!! info "What connected communities can do that isolated individuals cannot"

    **Connected communities can:**

    - Advocate for responsible AI deployment in local services
    - Provide mutual support when AI-mediated services fail
    - Maintain trusted communication networks
    - Build collective capacity for information verification
    - Protect vulnerable community members from algorithmic harms
    - Shape local responses to technological change

    **Isolated individuals cannot.**

### Building community AI preparedness groups

**What they do:**

- Monitor AI deployment in local services (council, schools, healthcare)
- Run community education and digital literacy programs
- Coordinate mutual aid and emergency response
- Advocate with councils and service providers
- Build local alternatives to extractive platforms

**Who's involved:**

- Community members with lived experience of algorithmic systems
- Technical volunteers (but not exclusively technical)
- Representatives from community organisations
- Local government staff (in partnership)
- Educators, librarians, community workers

**How to start:**

**Step 1: Initial organising (Month 1-2)**
- Identify 5-10 interested people
- Hold first meeting (library, community centre, online)
- Share concerns and priorities
- Agree on initial focus area

**Step 2: Build understanding (Month 3-4)**
- Learn about AI impacts together (use [AGI scenarios](/agi-scenarios/))
- Map local AI deployments and dependencies
- Connect with other groups (digital rights, mutual aid, emergency management)

**Step 3: Take action (Month 5+)**
- Choose one concrete project (see examples below)
- Divide tasks based on interests and skills
- Review progress regularly

### Organising principles that work

!!! tip "Five principles for effective community organising"

    **1. Start where people are**

    Don't lead with "AGI risk" or technical AI safety concepts. Start with concrete local impacts: algorithmic denials (Centrelink, housing, credit), information verification during emergencies, or AI in council decisions without community input.

    **2. Make it practical, not abstract**

    Focus on tangible actions: building emergency contact lists, learning verification together, asking council about AI systems they use.

    **3. Build on existing community strengths**

    Communities already have neighbourhood connections, organisations, volunteers, local knowledge. Don't start from scratch—enhance what exists.

    **4. Include diverse voices**

    Seek out people affected by AI systems: Centrelink recipients navigating automated assessments, gig workers under algorithmic management, students using AI in education, seniors excluded by digital services, migrants facing AI-powered visa decisions.

    **5. Take care of each other**

    Organising is sustained by sharing tasks, celebrating wins, supporting each other, and having fun. Community resilience starts with resilient communities.

## Council engagement guide

Local councils make decisions about AI in planning, service delivery, and community infrastructure. They're more accessible than state or federal government.

### Why engage with council on AI

**Councils deploy AI:**
- Planning and development assessment
- Service delivery (waste, parking, facilities)
- Community services (libraries, centres)
- Infrastructure management
- Procurement of services that include AI

**Councils can:**
- Require transparency about AI use
- Consult community on AI deployments
- Set standards for vendors
- Fund community digital resilience
- Integrate AI risks into emergency planning

### Understanding council AI governance

**Who decides:**


**Council officers (staff):**

- Day-to-day decisions about technology
- Implement policy set by council
- Usually technical or department-specific focus

**Councillors (elected):**

- Set strategic direction and policy
- Approve budgets and major contracts
- Accountable to community

**Your engagement approach should target the right level:**
- Technical concerns → council officers
- Policy concerns → councillors
- Strategic concerns → both, plus public submissions

### How to engage effectively

=== "Step 1: Understand"

    **Request information:**

    - "What AI systems does council currently use or plan to deploy?"
    - "How does council assess AI systems before deployment?"
    - "What community consultation occurs about AI use?"
    - "How can residents appeal AI-assisted decisions?"

    **Freedom of Information if needed:** Right to request documents about AI procurement, policies, risk assessments.

=== "Step 2: Build relationships"

    **Find champions:**

    - Councillors interested in digital rights, transparency, community resilience
    - Council officers working on innovation, digital services
    - Library staff (often digital inclusion focus)

    **Offer to help:**

    - "We're organising community education on AI—can council support?"
    - "We'd like to provide community feedback on AI policy—who should we talk to?"

    **Be constructive:**

    - Frame as helping council meet its responsibilities
    - Offer solutions, not just criticism
    - Position community as partner

=== "Step 3: Make submissions"

    **Council consultations:**

    - Watch for public consultations on relevant topics
    - Make written submissions
    - Attend public hearings
    - Mobilise others to submit

    **Request council meetings:**

    - Most councils allow community deputations
    - Request time to present on AI governance (5-10 minutes)
    - Provide written materials

    **What to include in submissions:**

    1. **Context:** Why AI governance matters for this community
    2. **Concerns:** Specific AI deployments or policies of concern
    3. **Recommendations:** Specific, actionable requests
    4. **Community support:** Number of community members, organisations endorsing

=== "Step 4: Public pressure"

    Use when council unresponsive to direct engagement:

    - Letters to local newspapers
    - Community petitions
    - Public forums
    - Approach state/federal representatives if needed

    !!! warning "Be strategic"
        Media pressure can backfire. Try constructive engagement first.

### Key recommendations for council AI governance

**Request councils establish:**

1. **Public AI register:** List of AI systems used, their purposes, governance
2. **Community consultation:** Before deploying AI in high-impact areas
3. **Governance policy:** Addressing evaluation, transparency, fairness, privacy, accountability
4. **Regular reporting:** Annual public report on AI use and governance
5. **Digital resilience:** Integrate AI risks into emergency management

**Example councils to reference:** Research other Australian councils that have implemented AI governance measures.

## Mutual aid networks

Mutual aid is communities taking care of each other. Essential for resilience to AI-related disruption.

### What is mutual aid?

!!! info "Mutual aid: Community solidarity, not charity"

    **Definition:** Voluntary, reciprocal exchange of resources and services for mutual benefit.

    **Different from charity:**

    - Reciprocal (everyone gives and receives)
    - Non-hierarchical (no provider/recipient roles)
    - Community-led (not institutional)
    - Based on solidarity

    **Examples:** Neighbours helping with errands, childcare, home repairs; community food sharing; skill sharing; emergency response.

### Why mutual aid matters for AI resilience

**When AI-mediated systems fail:**

- Service delivery may be disrupted
- Employment income may be affected
- Information may be unreliable
- Coordination may be harder

**Strong mutual aid networks can:**

- Provide support when formal systems fail
- Share resources and skills
- Coordinate collective response
- Look after vulnerable community members
- Maintain community cohesion under stress

### Building mutual aid networks

**Step 1: Map community assets**

**What the community has:**

- Skills (home repair, cooking, childcare, tech support, medical)
- Resources (tools, vehicles, spaces, food production)
- Knowledge (local history, languages, accessibility needs)
- Connections (to services, organisations, other communities)

**How to map:** Community meetings, surveys, one-on-one conversations, existing groups

**Step 2: Start simple**


Begin with:

- Neighbourhood contact lists
- Simple needs and offers (Facebook group, Signal group, noticeboard)
- Regular community gatherings (build relationships)
- Small asks and offers (build culture of mutual aid)

**Step 3: Practice activation**


Don't wait for real emergency:

- "Check-in days" (practice contacting each other)
- Small requests (build habit of asking and offering)
- Practice runs (simulate emergency, test response)

**Step 4: Include everyone**


Seek out people often isolated (seniors, people with disabilities, migrants, single parents).

Remove barriers (multiple communication methods, accessible spaces, translation, childcare, transport).

### Mutual aid during AI-related disruptions

!!! example "How mutual aid responds to AI-related crises"

    **Scenario: AI-mediated service failure** (e.g., automated Centrelink system down, payments delayed)

    Mutual aid response: Food sharing, interest-free loans between members, bulk buying, shared childcare, advocacy support

    **Scenario: AI-enabled information crisis** (e.g., sophisticated misinformation during emergency)

    Mutual aid response: Designated information verifiers, multiple communication channels, in-person verification, trusted communication network

    **Scenario: Employment disruption from automation** (e.g., major local employer automates)

    Mutual aid response: Skill sharing and retraining, job search support, resource sharing, cooperative economic projects, advocacy

## Community scenario exercises

Practicing community response to AI-related disruptions builds capacity and identifies gaps.

### Why scenario exercises matter

!!! tip "Benefits of practicing before crisis hits"

    Scenario exercises reveal hidden dependencies, identify capability gaps, build relationships, and make abstract risks tangible—all before real crisis hits.

### How to run scenario exercises

!!! example "Two formats for community scenario exercises"

    **Tabletop exercise (10-20 people, 2-3 hours):**

    Present scenario → discuss immediate response in small groups → identify gaps and assets → plan concrete actions → reflect on learnings.

    **Community workshop (30-100 people, 3-4 hours):**

    Introduction → rotate small groups through multiple scenarios → synthesize common themes → prioritise actions → form working groups.

### Scenarios for community exercises

**Use [AGI scenarios](/agi-scenarios/) adapted for local context:**

- **Information Ecosystems:** AI-generated deepfakes during local elections—how do we verify information and maintain informed participation?
- **Gradual Disempowerment:** 30% local job losses to automation over 5 years—what community economic initiatives and mutual aid do we need?
- **Critical Infrastructure:** 3-5 day power failure from AI system error during heatwave—who's most vulnerable and how do we coordinate without digital platforms?

**Create local scenarios** based on community-specific risks: major employer automating, council deploying flawed AI, misinformation during local crisis, platform failures, algorithmic discrimination.

### After the scenario exercise

**Don't let it end with the exercise:**

**Immediate follow-up:**

- Share summary of discussion
- Circulate action items
- Thank participants

**Ongoing action:**

- Form working groups for priorities
- Schedule check-ins on progress
- Integrate into community planning

**Track improvements:**

- Repeat exercises periodically
- Assess whether preparedness has improved

## Emergency communication plans

How to maintain communication when AI-mediated systems fail or are compromised.

### Why emergency communication planning matters

!!! warning "Platform dependence creates critical vulnerability"

    **Current reality:**

    - Most community communication is platform-mediated (Facebook, WhatsApp)
    - Platforms can fail, be shut down, or be compromised
    - AI-generated content can pollute information during crises
    - Internet may be unavailable

    **Resilient communities need:**

    - Multiple communication methods
    - Trusted verification processes
    - Clear information sources
    - Practiced activation procedures

### Building communication capacity

| **Layer** | **Methods** | **When to use** | **Limitations** |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **1. Platform-based** | Facebook groups, WhatsApp, email lists | Everyday communication | Requires internet & platforms; can fail |
| **2. Resilient digital** | Signal, mesh networks, community radio | Critical communication & backup | Some technical setup required |
| **3. Offline manual** | Phone trees, printed lists, in-person | When digital systems fail | Labor-intensive; slower reach |

**Defence-in-depth principle:** Each layer provides backup for the layer above.

### Setting up emergency systems

**Step 1: Map current communication**

Audit:

- How does community currently communicate?
- What would fail if platforms/internet down?
- Who would be unreachable?

**Step 2: Build redundancy**

For each critical communication need, have 3 methods:

- Primary (platform-based)
- Secondary (resilient digital)
- Tertiary (offline/manual)

!!! example "Warning residents of immediate danger"

    - **Primary:** Facebook post, SMS via council alert
    - **Secondary:** Community radio, Signal groups, mesh network
    - **Tertiary:** Phone tree, door-knocking, community siren

**Step 3: Establish trusted information sources**

**Identify official sources:**

- ABC Radio (reliable emergency broadcaster)
- Council website and social media
- State emergency services (VicEmergency, Fires Near Me, etc.)
- Bureau of Meteorology

**Create community information hub:**

- Physical location (community centre, library)
- Staffed during emergencies
- Official information displayed

**Step 4: Designate roles**

**Key roles:**

- **Communication coordinator:** Activates systems, monitors official sources
- **Information verifiers:** Check claims against official sources
- **Network nodes:** Community members responsible for 5-10 households each
- **Technical support:** Maintains digital systems

**Step 5: Practice activation**

**Quarterly drills:**

- Activate communication systems
- Test all layers (digital, offline, manual)
- Time how long to reach everyone
- Update systems based on learnings

### Information verification during emergencies

!!! warning "When AI-generated misinformation could be life-threatening"

    **Trusted source first:**

    - Default to official sources (ABC, emergency services, council)
    - Verify before acting on social media information
    - Be very skeptical of dramatic claims

    **Verification checklist:**

    - Is this from official source?
    - Can I verify with second official source?
    - Does this match what I'm seeing directly?
    - Is the information actionable and safe?

    **When uncertain:**

    - Don't spread unverified information
    - Seek clarification from official sources
    - Err on side of safety

### Reaching vulnerable community members

!!! info "Ensuring no one is left behind during emergencies"

    **Who may be harder to reach:**

    - Seniors without digital literacy
    - People with disabilities
    - People without stable housing
    - Migrants with language barriers
    - People in social isolation

    **Strategies:**

    - Pre-identify vulnerable individuals (through community organisations)
    - Assign specific people to check on them
    - Provide accessible information (multiple formats, languages)
    - In-person delivery if needed
