# Communities & Households

## Who this is for

Australian communities and households: community organisations, NGOs, local councils, emergency management groups, schools, libraries, neighbourhood networks, families.

---

## The challenge

Advanced AI systems are being embedded in services, information sources, and decisions that affect everyday Australians—from Centrelink assessments to local job markets, from news to emergency management.

**Key realities:**

- Algorithmic decisions affect who gets services, housing, jobs
- AI-generated content shapes what information people see and trust
- Automation changes local employment and economic opportunity
- AI-mediated communication affects how communities organise and respond

**Why communities matter:**

- Strong local networks can adapt when systems fail
- Trusted relationships matter more than algorithms during crises
- Local knowledge and mutual aid can't be easily automated
- Community voice shapes what's acceptable and what must change

**Key insight:** Bottom-up resilience and social cohesion will be critical as AI systems become more embedded in daily life.

## Why community voice matters even if AGI is safe

!!! tip "Democratic participation isn't optional—even with technically safe AI"

    **Even if AGI is perfectly aligned and safe,** communities still need to shape how it's used:

    **Whose values does it serve?**
    - Safe AI aligned with corporate profit motives won't necessarily reflect community values
    - Technical safety doesn't ensure systems respect local context, culture, or priorities
    - Communities must have input on what counts as "good" outcomes

    **What should remain human?**
    - Even if AI can automate teaching, healthcare, or community services, should it?
    - Communities should decide what activities are valuable because humans do them
    - Local agency and participation matter beyond pure efficiency

    **Who benefits from transformation?**
    - Safe AGI that automates knowledge work still reshapes local employment and meaning
    - Communities should shape how economic gains are distributed
    - Local organizing determines whether transformation strengthens or fragments social bonds

    **How do we maintain democratic participation?**
    - Safe AI mediating information can still shape what people see and believe
    - Communities need capacity to verify information and coordinate action
    - Democratic legitimacy requires meaningful citizen input, not just technical safety

    **Community voice isn't about defending against catastrophe — it's about ensuring AGI transformation serves everyone, not just those who build or control it.**

## How sectors work together

Communities don't face AI risks alone—your experiences and actions connect to what government and business do:

**Government needs community input:** [Government policy decisions](../government-policy/index.md) about what AI systems are acceptable should reflect community values and lived experience. Your advocacy shapes what regulations protect and what gets deployed.

**Business impacts communities:** [Corporate AI deployment decisions](../business-industry/index.md) affect local employment, service access and whether you can get help from a human when algorithms fail. Business [resilience planning](../business-industry/agi-preparedness-strategy.md) determines whether essential services continue during disruptions.

**Communities inform both sectors:** Your early warnings about AI systems that aren't working help [government](../government-policy/index.md) improve oversight and [business](../business-industry/index.md) fix problems before they cascade. Strong local networks provide the resilience that government and business depend on.

**Key insight:** Community resilience isn't separate from [government coordination](../government-policy/coordination.md) or [business continuity planning](../business-industry/agi-preparedness-strategy.md)—they're interconnected. Understanding what other sectors are doing helps communities prepare more effectively.

## Communities' role through C·A·G·R

### :lucide-shield-ban: Containment

Communities can influence what gets deployed.

**Key actions:**

- Advocate against untested AI in essential local services
- Demand transparency about AI use by councils and service providers
- Support local alternatives to extractive platforms
- Resist systems that erode local agency

### :lucide-target: Alignment

Communities can demand AI serves community interests.

**Key actions:**

- Insist AI systems respect local values and context
- Challenge algorithmic decisions that harm community members
- Advocate for explainability and human review
- Support AI that strengthens rather than replaces human connection

### :lucide-scale: Governance

Communities can shape rules and accountability.

**Key actions:**

- Engage with local councils on AI governance
- Support strong regulation that protects community interests
- Document harms from algorithmic systems
- Participate in consultations on AI policy

### :lucide-shield: Resilience

Communities can build capacity to withstand disruption.

**Key actions:**

- Maintain communication networks that don't depend on platforms
- Build mutual aid systems and local organising capacity
- Practice information verification and media literacy
- Develop local skills that can't be easily automated
