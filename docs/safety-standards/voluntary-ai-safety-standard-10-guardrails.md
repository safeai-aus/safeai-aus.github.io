# Voluntary AI Safety Standard (10 Guardrails)

Australia’s **Voluntary AI Safety Standard** provides ten practical guardrails organisations can adopt now to deploy and use AI safely and responsibly.  

The standard was developed by the Department of Industry, Science and Resources (DISR) and first published in November 2023. In 2024, the guardrails were updated following consultation to align more closely with the Government’s proposed mandatory guardrails for high-risk AI applications.  

The standard is **voluntary** and complements existing Australian law. It provides a practical framework for organisations to manage AI safely while future regulation is considered.  

Importantly, the 10 guardrails are consistent with leading international standards and frameworks, including:  

- [**ISO/IEC 42001:2023** – AI Management System Standard](https://www.iso.org/standard/81230.html)  
- [**NIST AI Risk Management Framework 1.0**](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework)  

## Why this matters
Adopting the guardrails early helps organisations build **trust, resilience, and regulatory readiness**. By embedding these practices now, businesses can:  

- Reduce risks from bias, errors, and misuse of AI  
- Strengthen transparency and customer confidence  
- Position themselves ahead of future mandatory compliance requirements
- Demonstrate leadership in responsible AI adoption  

## The 10 Guardrails
1. Establish accountability  
2. Implement risk management  
3. Protect data  
4. Ensure transparency  
5. Enable human control  
6. Test reliability  
7. Monitor impacts  
8. Ensure accountability in the supply chain  
9. Maintain records  
10. Support human autonomy  

## What the guardrails do
- Encourage **transparency and accountability** for AI systems.  
- Require **risk assessment, testing, and human oversight** before and after deployment.  
- Promote **record-keeping** and **supplier due-diligence** across the AI supply chain.  
- Emphasise **stakeholder engagement** and ongoing monitoring as systems evolve.

## How to use this in your business
1. Adopt the 10 guardrails as acceptance criteria for any AI initiative.  
2. Update policies and procurement to reflect supplier alignment with the guardrails.  
3. Integrate testing, documentation, and oversight into your normal change-management.  
4. Review systems at least annually or on material change.

- *Best:* Full algorithmic transparency  

**Guardrail 5: Enable human control**

- *Best:* Human-in-the-loop for all critical processes  

**Guardrail 6: Test reliability**

## When guardrails could become mandatory  

*Disclaimer: As of August 2025, it remains uncertain if, when, and how the Voluntary AI Safety Standard will become mandatory. This is subject to an ongoing political and legislative process in Australia, and requirements may change.*

### Government's principles-based definition of "high-risk AI"
In its consultation on mandatory guardrails for AI in high-risk settings, the Australian Government proposes a principles-based approach.  
An AI application may be considered *high-risk* if it has a high likelihood of causing material harm in one or more of the following areas:

- Human rights or freedoms  
- Health and safety  
- Legal rights or obligations  
- Democratic processes  
- Environmental outcomes  
- Broader societal impacts  

Risk is assessed based on **context, severity, and scale**, rather than a predetermined list of application types.  
Source: [Australian Human Rights Commission – Mandatory Guardrails for AI in High-Risk Settings (PDF)](https://humanrights.gov.au/sites/default/files/mandatory_guardrails_for_ai_in_high_risk_settings_0.pdf)

### Illustrative examples from public commentary
The following examples are **not part of the official government definition**. They are drawn from media, legal analyses, and the 2024 Senate inquiry into AI, which recommended that certain AI systems and general-purpose models be treated as high risk.  
Senate Inquiry report: [“Australian Government should regulate generative AI” – The Guardian, 27 Nov 2024](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/27/amazon-google-and-meta-are-pillaging-culture-data-and-creativity-to-train-ai-australian-inquiry-finds)

**Examples often cited as potentially high-risk in public discussions:**  

- Healthcare diagnosis or treatment  
- Employment decisions (hiring, firing, promotion)  
- Financial services (loans, insurance)  
- Government service delivery  
- Critical infrastructure  
- Legal decisions  

**General-purpose applications** (likely to remain voluntary under current proposals):  

- Marketing automation  
- Customer service chatbots  
- Internal productivity tools  
- Content generation  
- Basic data analysis
