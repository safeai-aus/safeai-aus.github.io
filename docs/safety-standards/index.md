!!! success "Key Principles"
    Australian AI regulation is built on several core principles:

    1. ⚖️ **Proportionality** — Higher-risk AI systems face greater scrutiny
    2. 📜 **Existing law applies** — AI is not exempt from privacy, discrimination, or consumer law
    3. 🤝 **Voluntary first** — Voluntary standards precede mandatory regulation
    4. 🌐 **International alignment** — Australian frameworks reference ISO, NIST, and EU approaches
    5. 🔍 **Transparency and accountability** — Clear documentation and governance are expected
