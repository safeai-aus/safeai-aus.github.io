# AI Standards & Legislation

Stay informed about the regulatory landscape for AI in Australia and internationally. This section provides practical guidance on compliance requirements, voluntary standards, and emerging legislation affecting AI adoption.

---

## Why Standards & Legislation Matter

As AI becomes more widely deployed across Australian organisations, understanding the regulatory and standards landscape is essential for:

- **Compliance**: Meeting current legal obligations under Australian law
- **Risk management**: Aligning with voluntary standards to reduce liability
- **Future-proofing**: Preparing for emerging regulations
- **Trust building**: Demonstrating responsible AI practices to stakeholders
- **International alignment**: Understanding how Australian standards relate to global frameworks

## What's In This Section

### Australian Standards

Australia's approach to AI regulation combines existing legislation with new voluntary frameworks:

- **[Relevant Australian Legislation](ai-australian-legislation.md)**
  Overview of Privacy Act, consumer law, discrimination law, and other existing regulations that apply to AI systems in Australia.

- **[Voluntary AI Safety Standard (VAISS) - 10 Guardrails](voluntary-ai-safety-standard-10-guardrails.md)**
  Australia's voluntary framework for safe AI development and deployment, with practical guidance on implementing each of the 10 guardrails.

- **[Guidance for AI Adoption (AI6)](guidance-for-ai-adoption-ai6.md)**
  The Australian Government's six-step framework for organisations adopting AI, designed to complement the 10 Guardrails.

### International Context

- **[International AI Legal Overview](international-ai-legal-overview.md)**
  How major jurisdictions (EU, US, UK, Singapore) are regulating AI, and what this means for Australian organisations with international operations.

## Where to Start

**New to AI regulation?**
Start with [Relevant Australian Legislation](ai-australian-legislation.md) to understand your current legal obligations.

**Implementing AI governance?**
Review the [Voluntary AI Safety Standard (10 Guardrails)](voluntary-ai-safety-standard-10-guardrails.md) and use it to structure your governance approach.

**Operating internationally?**
Check the [International AI Legal Overview](international-ai-legal-overview.md) to understand cross-border requirements.

## Key Principles

Australian AI regulation is built on several core principles:

1. **Proportionality**: Higher-risk AI systems face greater scrutiny
2. **Existing law applies**: AI is not exempt from privacy, discrimination, or consumer law
3. **Voluntary first**: Voluntary standards precede mandatory regulation
4. **Alignment with international standards**: Australian frameworks reference ISO, NIST, and EU approaches
5. **Transparency and accountability**: Clear documentation and governance are expected
