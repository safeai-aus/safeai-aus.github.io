# International AI Legal Landscape (2026) — What Australian Businesses Should Know

> **Purpose:** Navigate international AI regulations affecting Australian organisations operating globally
> **Audience:** Legal, compliance, international business and governance teams | **Time:** 60-90 minutes

*Last updated: January 2026. This page is informational and not legal advice.*

!!! note "Rapidly evolving landscape"
    International AI regulations are changing fast. South Korea's AI Basic Act takes effect in January 2026 with implementing rules still emerging. Canada's AIDA died on the Order Paper and any replacement may differ substantially. Always verify current status with official sources before making compliance decisions.

As AI regulation accelerates globally, many jurisdictions already impose binding requirements or have near-term obligations that will affect Australian organisations exporting, operating, or handling data linked to those regions.

Below is a practical snapshot of the US, Canada, EU, UK, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, plus the global frameworks most often referenced by regulators.

## Executive Snapshot

!!! info "Key Jurisdictions at a Glance"
    - 🇪🇺 **EU** — The **EU AI Act** is in force with staged obligations. Bans on "unacceptable risk" uses started **2 Feb 2025**; **general-purpose AI (GPAI)** duties start **2 Aug 2025**; most remaining rules phase in through **2026–2027**. Expect documentation, transparency, risk management and post-market monitoring obligations if you sell into the EU or provide GPAI there.

    - 🇺🇸 **US** — No single federal AI law. Federal direction runs through **NIST AI RMF 1.0** and public-sector guidance (**OMB M-24-10**). States are moving: **Colorado's AI Act** (effective **30 June 2026**) requires risk programs, impact assessments and notices for "high-risk" AI. NYC mandates bias audits for automated hiring tools.

    - 🇨🇦 **Canada** — The federal **Artificial Intelligence and Data Act (AIDA)** (within Bill C-27) **died on the Order Paper** in January 2025 when Parliament was prorogued. Any future legislation may differ substantially; no timeline for re-introduction.

    - 🇬🇧 **UK** — No single AI Act; **regulator-led, "pro-innovation"** model with central government coordination and the **AI Security Institute** (rebranded Feb 2025). Regulators are issuing sector guidance and pilots (assurance, sandboxes). The **Data (Use and Access) Act** (mid-2025) marks the UK's first statutory step toward AI-relevant obligations.

    - 🇯🇵 **Japan** — On **28 May 2025** Parliament approved the **AI Promotion Act** (Japan's first AI law, effective 4 June 2025), establishing the AI Strategy Headquarters. Compliance remains guideline-driven via the **AI Guidelines for Business** (2024) and existing laws (privacy, consumer).

    - 🇰🇷 **South Korea** — Passed the **AI Basic Act** (**promulgated 21 Jan 2025; effective 22 Jan 2026**). Establishes national governance, trustworthiness requirements and enables future rules; extra-territorial effects likely for some activities.

    - 🇸🇬 **Singapore** — Leading with **Model AI Governance Framework (GenAI)** and the open-source **AI Verify** testing toolkit. Often used as a practical implementation benchmark, interoperable with NIST AI RMF.

!!! success "Why This Matters for Australian Businesses"
    - 🌏 **Export exposure:** Selling AI products/services into the EU, UK or Korea may trigger local **provider/deployer** duties even if you're based in Australia
    - 📋 **Procurement pressure:** Multinationals will increasingly require **AI risk assessments, bias testing and documentation** aligned to EU/US frameworks (EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001)
    - 🔄 **Interoperability benefits:** Adopting **risk-based** governance now reduces later retrofit costs and smooths compliance across markets

## Jurisdiction Guides

### European Union (EU)

**Status & scope:** The **EU AI Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689)** is live with a **risk-tiered** regime (prohibited, high, limited, minimal), dedicated **GPAI** obligations and strong enforcement (up to 7% global turnover). Key dates: **2 Feb 2025** (prohibitions), **2 Aug 2025** (GPAI, governance/penalties), **from Aug 2026–27** (most high-risk rules).

!!! warning "What to Do"
    - ✅ Map any **EU-facing** AI systems to risk categories; identify if you're a **provider**, **deployer**, **importer** or **distributor**
    - ✅ For **GPAI/models**, prepare **training-data summaries**, technical documentation and risk-mitigation processes (red-teaming, incident reporting)

### United States (US)

**Status & scope:** No omnibus federal AI law. Federal levers include **NIST AI RMF 1.0** (widely adopted) and **OMB M-24-10** (governance for US federal agencies). States and cities are active: **Colorado SB24-205** (effective **30 June 2026**, delayed from the original February 2026 date via SB 25B-004) mandates **risk management programs, impact assessments, consumer notices and appeal/human review** for "high-risk" AI; **NYC Local Law 144** requires **bias audits and notices** for automated hiring tools.

!!! warning "What to Do"
    - ✅ Align your program to **NIST AI RMF** (often accepted as a **defence/interoperability** baseline, including in Colorado's framework)
    - ✅ If serving US customers/employers, build **impact assessment** and **bias-audit** capability into your lifecycle

### Canada

**Status & scope:** Bill C-27 (which included the federal Artificial Intelligence and Data Act, AIDA) died on the Order Paper on 6 January 2025 when Parliament was prorogued. The bill would need to be completely re-introduced in a future parliamentary session. Any future AI legislation is expected to take a different approach; status remains highly uncertain. Note: Ontario's **Bill 194** (passed November 2024) regulates public sector AI use provincially.

!!! warning "What to Do"
    No federal AI-specific law is imminent. Continue monitoring for potential re-introduction under a new government. Organisations can still reference AIDA's former companion guidance for voluntary best practices (risk-based duties for "high-impact" systems, impact assessments, incident reporting), but recognise any future legislation may differ substantially.

### United Kingdom (UK)

**Status & scope:** **No single AI Act**; the UK follows a **contextual, regulator-led** approach under the **Government Response (Feb 2024)** to its AI White Paper. Central functions coordinate regulators; the **AI Security Institute** (rebranded from "AI Safety Institute" in February 2025) evaluates advanced systems and supports guidance/testing. The **Data (Use and Access) Act** (mid-2025) introduced provisions affecting AI training datasets and algorithmic accountability.

!!! warning "What to Do"
    - ✅ Track sector regulators (ICO, CMA, FCA, MHRA etc.)
    - ✅ Expect **assurance**, **transparency**, and **evaluation** asks for frontier/GPAI uses
    - ✅ Monitor the **Data (Use and Access) Act** for AI training data and algorithmic accountability requirements

### Japan

**Status & scope:** Japan emphasises **soft-law** via the **AI Guidelines for Business (2024, METI/MIC)**, updated subsequently. On **28 May 2025** Parliament approved the **AI Promotion Act** (Japan's first AI law), with most provisions taking effect **4 June 2025**. The Act establishes the AI Strategy Headquarters under the Prime Minister's Office and focuses on R&D promotion and voluntary guidelines rather than hard restrictions.

!!! warning "What to Do"
    - ✅ Apply the **Guidelines** lifecycle controls (risk identification, governance, transparency)
    - ✅ Ensure compliance with **APPI** and sector rules

### Republic of Korea (South Korea)

**Status & scope:** **AI Basic Act** (officially "Basic Act on the Development of AI and the Establishment of a Foundation for Trustworthiness") passed **26 Dec 2024**, **promulgated 21 Jan 2025**, **effective 22 Jan 2026**. Creates national governance (AI committee, safety institute), a trustworthiness baseline and foundation for detailed rules; **extra-territorial reach** is anticipated in some areas. Fines up to KRW 30 million (~$20,870) and potential imprisonment for violations.

!!! warning "What to Do"
    - ✅ If offering AI into Korea, prepare for **registration/notice**, **risk management**, and **safety/trust** controls as implementing measures roll out

### Singapore

**Status & scope:** **Model AI Governance Framework (GenAI)** and the **AI Verify** testing toolkit provide **practical, testable** governance guidance; mapped to **NIST AI RMF** for interoperability. Frequently used by multinationals for **assurance**.

!!! warning "What to Do"
    - ✅ Use **AI Verify** (or equivalent) for **bias, robustness, transparency** testing
    - ✅ Publish **assurance artefacts** for enterprise buyers
