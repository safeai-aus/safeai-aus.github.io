# International AI Legal Landscape (2025) — What Australian Businesses Should Know

*Last updated: 20 October 2025 (AUS/Adelaide). This page is informational and not legal advice.*

As AI regulation accelerates globally, many jurisdictions already impose binding requirements or have near-term obligations that will affect Australian organisations exporting, operating, or handling data linked to those regions. 

Below is a practical snapshot of the US, Canada, EU, UK, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, plus the global frameworks most often referenced by regulators.

---

## Executive Snapshot

- **EU** — The **EU AI Act** is in force with staged obligations. Bans on “unacceptable risk” uses started **2 Feb 2025**; **general-purpose AI (GPAI)** duties start **2 Aug 2025**; most remaining rules phase in through **2026–2027**. Expect documentation, transparency, risk management and post-market monitoring obligations if you sell into the EU or provide GPAI there.  
- **US** — No single federal AI law. Federal direction runs through **NIST AI RMF 1.0** and public-sector guidance (**OMB M-24-10**). States are moving: **Colorado’s AI Act** (effective **30 June 2026**) requires risk programs, impact assessments and notices for “high-risk” AI. NYC mandates bias audits for automated hiring tools.
- **Canada** — The federal **Artificial Intelligence and Data Act (AIDA)** (within Bill C-27) has **not been enacted** as of Aug 2025; it may be revisited in a new parliamentary session. Draft guidance remains a good indicator of direction (risk-based duties for “high-impact” systems).  
- **UK** — No single AI Act; **regulator-led, “pro-innovation”** model with central government coordination and the **UK AI Safety Institute**. Regulators are issuing sector guidance and pilots (assurance, sandboxes).  
- **Japan** — Operates “**soft-law**” guidance (**AI Guidelines for Business**, 2024; updated thereafter). In **May 2025** Japan approved an **AI Promotion Act** focused on coordination and R&D; compliance is driven via guidelines and existing laws (e.g., privacy, consumer).  
- **South Korea** — Passed the **AI Basic/Framework Act** (**promulgated 21 Jan 2025; effective Jan 2026**). Establishes national governance, trustworthiness requirements and enables future rules; extra-territorial effects likely for some activities.  
- **Singapore** — Leading with **Model AI Governance Framework (GenAI)** and the open-source **AI Verify** testing toolkit. Often used as a practical implementation benchmark, interoperable with NIST AI RMF.

## Why this matters for Australian businesses

- **Export exposure:** Selling AI products/services into the EU, UK or Korea may trigger local **provider/deployer** duties even if you’re based in Australia.  
- **Procurement pressure:** Multinationals will increasingly require **AI risk assessments, bias testing, and documentation** aligned to EU/US frameworks (EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001).  
- **Interoperability benefits:** Adopting **risk-based** governance now reduces later retrofit costs and smooths compliance across markets.

## Jurisdiction Guides

### European Union (EU)
**Status & scope:** The **EU AI Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689)** is live with a **risk-tiered** regime (prohibited, high, limited, minimal), dedicated **GPAI** obligations, and strong enforcement (up to 7% global turnover). Key dates: **2 Feb 2025** (prohibitions), **2 Aug 2025** (GPAI, governance/penalties), **from Aug 2026–27** (most high-risk rules).  
**What to do:**

- Map any **EU-facing** AI systems to risk categories; identify if you’re a **provider**, **deployer**, **importer** or **distributor**.  
- For **GPAI/models**, prepare **training-data summaries**, technical documentation, and risk-mitigation processes (red-teaming, incident reporting).  

### United States (US)
**Status & scope:** No omnibus federal AI law. Federal levers include **NIST AI RMF 1.0** (widely adopted) and **OMB M-24-10** (governance for US federal agencies). States and cities are active: **Colorado SB24-205** (effective **30 June 2026**, delayed from the original February 2026 date via SB 25B-004) mandates **risk management programs, impact assessments, consumer notices and appeal/human review** for “high-risk” AI; **NYC Local Law 144** requires **bias audits and notices** for automated hiring tools.
**What to do:**

- Align your program to **NIST AI RMF** (often accepted as a **defence/interoperability** baseline, including in Colorado’s framework).  
- If serving US customers/employers, build **impact assessment** and **bias-audit** capability into your lifecycle.  

### Canada
**Status & scope:** Bill C-27 (which included the federal Artificial Intelligence and Data Act, AIDA) died on the Order Paper on 6 January 2025 when Parliament was prorogued. The bill would need to be completely re-introduced in a future parliamentary session. In June 2025, Minister Evan Solomon confirmed AIDA will not return in its original form, signaling a "light, tight, right" approach to any future AI regulation. Status remains highly uncertain as of October 2025.
**What to do:** No federal AI-specific law is imminent. Continue monitoring for potential re-introduction under a new government. Organizations can still reference AIDA's former companion guidance for voluntary best practices (risk-based duties for "high-impact" systems, impact assessments, incident reporting), but recognise any future legislation may differ substantially.

### United Kingdom (UK)
**Status & scope:** **No single AI Act**; the UK follows a **contextual, regulator-led** approach under the **Government Response (Feb 2024)** to its AI White Paper. Central functions coordinate regulators; the **UK AI Safety Institute** evaluates advanced systems and supports guidance/testing.  
**What to do:** Track sector regulators (ICO, CMA, FCA, MHRA etc.). Expect **assurance**, **transparency**, and **evaluation** asks for frontier/GPAI uses.

### Japan
**Status & scope:** Japan emphasises **soft-law** via the **AI Guidelines for Business (2024, METI/MIC)**, updated subsequently; in **May 2025** Parliament approved an **AI Promotion Act** to coordinate policy and R&D (not a prescriptive compliance code).  
**What to do:** Apply the **Guidelines** lifecycle controls (risk identification, governance, transparency) and ensure compliance with **APPI** and sector rules.

### Republic of Korea (South Korea)
**Status & scope:** **AI Basic/Framework Act** passed **26 Dec 2024**, **promulgated 21 Jan 2025**, **effective Jan 2026**. Creates national governance (AI committee, safety institute), a trustworthiness baseline, and foundation for detailed rules; **extra-territorial reach** is anticipated in some areas.  
**What to do:** If offering AI into Korea, prepare for **registration/notice**, **risk management**, and **safety/trust** controls as implementing measures roll out.

### Singapore
**Status & scope:** **Model AI Governance Framework (GenAI)** and the **AI Verify** testing toolkit provide **practical, testable** governance guidance; mapped to **NIST AI RMF** for interoperability. Frequently used by multinationals for **assurance**.  
**What to do:** Use **AI Verify** (or equivalent) for **bias, robustness, transparency** testing and publish **assurance artefacts** for enterprise buyers.
