# External Resources

This page provides curated resources for building decentralised AI alternatives and democratic technology governance. Rather than attempting to duplicate the expertise of specialist organisations, SafeAI-Aus points you to the best resources for detailed implementation guidance.

!!! info "Resource categories"

    **Australian organisations** — groups working on digital rights, cooperatives, and community technology in Australia

    **International organisations** — global networks for platform cooperativism and community tech

    **Tools and software** — open-source AI tools, governance platforms, and infrastructure

    **Learning and funding** — educational resources and funding opportunities

**Inclusion in this list doesn't constitute endorsement of all positions.** These resources are starting points for your own investigation.

## Australian Organisations

Australia has established organisations working on digital rights, cooperative economy, and community technology. These groups provide expertise, advocacy, and practical support for building alternatives.

### Cooperative Economy

!!! tip "BCCM is THE Australian resource for cooperative formation"

    If you're considering forming a cooperative or want to understand cooperative models, **[BCCM](https://bccm.coop/)** is the essential starting point. They provide formation guidance, legal templates, case studies, and connections to state-based agencies.

## Open-Source AI Tools

The tools below enable local AI deployment and open-source development. Rather than depending on cloud APIs, these allow you to run AI on your own infrastructure.

!!! tip "Start with Ollama for local deployment"

    **[Ollama](https://ollama.com/)** is the easiest way to run open-source language models locally. Install it on your computer and start experimenting with local AI in minutes.

### Local Deployment

- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) — Run LLMs locally with easy setup (best starting point)
- [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) — GUI application for local LLMs (user-friendly interface)
- [GPT4All](https://gpt4all.io/) — Open-source local AI with simple installation

### Model Repositories

- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) — Central repository for open-source models and datasets (thousands of models available)

### Infrastructure

!!! note "About this list"

    **Curation, not comprehensiveness:** This list prioritises quality over quantity. It's not exhaustive—it's a starting point.

    **Periodic review:** Resources are reviewed and updated as the landscape evolves.

    **No blanket endorsement:** Inclusion doesn't mean SafeAI-Aus endorses everything an organisation does or says.

    **Suggest additions:** When a public feedback mechanism is available, you'll be able to suggest resources for inclusion.

## Using these resources effectively

**Start with Australian organisations** — they understand local context, legal frameworks, and cultural factors that international resources may miss.

**BCCM is essential for cooperative formation** — don't try to figure out Australian cooperative law from international resources. BCCM and state agencies know the local requirements.

**International examples inform, don't prescribe** — what works in Barcelona or Taiwan provides ideas, but Australian implementation requires adaptation to our context.

**Tools are means, not ends** — governance software doesn't create democracy. It supports democratic processes when used intentionally.

**Combine resources** — effective work draws on digital rights advocacy (EFA), cooperative development (BCCM), community organising, and technical tools together.
