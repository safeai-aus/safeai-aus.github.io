## Using These Resources Effectively

!!! tip "Getting the Most from This List"

    **Start with Australian organisations** — Local groups like AI Safety Australia, Melbourne AI Safety and university research centers understand Australian context, regulations and community needs.

    **Connect with local AI safety communities** — Attend meetups in Melbourne, Sydney, or your city. Online communities are valuable but local connections matter for practical collaboration.

    **Government resources are authoritative** — For Australian AI policy and standards, prioritize official sources (DISR, Australian AI Safety Institute, state government frameworks).

    **International research informs local action** — Global AI safety research from Anthropic, DeepMind and research institutes provides technical foundations, but implementation requires Australian adaptation.

    **Combine technical and policy perspectives** — Effective AI governance integrates technical AI safety knowledge with local policy, legal requirements and community engagement.
