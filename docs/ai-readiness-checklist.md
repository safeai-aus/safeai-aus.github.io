# AI Readiness Checklist

This checklist helps Australian businesses determine if they are ready to adopt AI safely, responsibly, and effectively.  
It is aligned with the **Voluntary AI Safety Standard** (Department of Industry, 2023; updated 2024) and its 10 Guardrails, as well as international standards such as ISO/IEC 42001:2023 and the NIST AI Risk Management Framework 1.0.  

Use it as a self-assessment tool before launching pilots or scaling AI solutions.

## Scoring (quick read)
- **0–15**: Early stage — focus on governance, legal compliance, and staff literacy before pilots  
- **16–30**: Developing — ready for low-risk pilots with strong oversight  
- **31–40**: Established — capable of scaling, with robust monitoring and controls  
- **41–50**: Advanced — industry-leading, continuously improving, and externally assured  

> Use this checklist with **Getting Started** guidance and the **Voluntary AI Safety Standard (10 Guardrails)**.  
> It complements Australian legal obligations under the **Privacy Act**, **Copyright Act**, **Competition and Consumer Act**, and **Work Health and Safety Act**.
