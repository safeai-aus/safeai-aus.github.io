# AI Implementation Roadmap

You've identified good first use cases. You understand the importance of change management. You've evaluated vendors carefully.

Now you need a practical roadmap for actually implementing AI: running pilots that generate real learning, making sound scale decisions, and building assurance practices that become business-as-usual.

This page provides that roadmap with specific guidance on sizing, timeframes, success criteria, and what "done" looks like at each stage.

---

## Who this page is for

This page is for:

- Project managers running AI pilots
- Transformation teams planning AI rollouts
- Business owners moving from pilot to production
- Anyone asking "what do we actually do, and in what order?"

If you're ready to move from planning to doing, this is for you.

## The four-stage roadmap

This roadmap is intentionally lightweight. The goal is to **move forward deliberately**, not to stall waiting for perfection.

Each stage has clear objectives, typical timeframes, and "what done looks like" criteria.

### Overview

1. **Explore and pilot** (2-4 months) – Learn what works in your environment
2. **Standardise and embed guardrails** (3-6 months) – Make safety and governance routine
3. **Scale what works** (6-12 months) – Expand successful patterns
4. **Continuously assure and improve** (ongoing) – Refine based on experience

---

## Stage 1: Explore and pilot (2-4 months)

**Objective:** Run small, focused pilots that generate real learning about what AI can and can't do in your specific environment.

### What to do

- **Identify 2-3 low-risk, high-learning use cases:**
  - Review [Safe AI Adoption - Getting Started](safe-ai-adoption-getting-started.md) for good first uses
  - Choose cases that are reversible and low-stakes
  - Pick at least one that builds resilience, not just cuts cost

- **Set up your AI System Register:**
  - Use the [AI Project Register Template](../governance-templates/ai-project-register.md) to track pilots
  - Even a simple spreadsheet is fine at this stage
  - Key fields: use case, owner, risk rating, status, decisions made

- **Run small pilots with clear parameters:**
  - **Pilot group size:** 5-15 people
    - **Why this size:** Large enough to generate meaningful data, small enough to support intensively
    - **Too small (1-3 people):** Doesn't reveal process or workflow issues
    - **Too large (30+ people):** Support burden becomes overwhelming, problems scale quickly

  - **Pilot duration:** 4-8 weeks for initial learning
    - **Week 1-2:** Setup, training, initial use with high support
    - **Week 3-5:** Regular use, feedback collection, issue resolution
    - **Week 6-8:** Evaluation, decision preparation
    - **Longer pilots (8-12 weeks):** Appropriate for defensive/security use cases or complex workflows

  - **Success criteria examples:**
    - "Reduces document drafting time by 20% while maintaining quality"
    - "Maintains 90% accuracy with human review required for all outputs"
    - "Staff report tool is helpful, not frustrating, in week 4 survey"
    - "Zero security incidents during pilot period"
    - "80% of pilot participants want to continue using the tool"

  - **Exit conditions (when to stop):**
    - "If error rate exceeds 15% after 4 weeks of tuning"
    - "If staff satisfaction score below 3/5 after training period"
    - "If integration issues remain unresolved after 6 weeks"
    - "If cost per task exceeds current manual process cost"

- **Complete AI Readiness Checklists:**
  - Use the [AI Readiness Checklist](../governance-templates/ai-readiness-checklist.md) for each pilot
  - Document risk assessment, privacy considerations, approval
  - Lightweight but systematic

- **Capture lessons learned:**
  - Weekly pilot review meetings (30 minutes)
  - End-of-pilot retrospective (document what worked, what didn't, what surprised you)
  - Feed insights back into system register and planning

### What "done" looks like

At the end of Stage 1, you should have:

✓ **Data on whether pilots met success criteria** (yes/no with supporting metrics)  
✓ **Documented lessons learned** (what worked, what didn't, what you'd do differently)  
✓ **Clear recommendation** for each pilot (scale / adjust and retry / stop)  
✓ **Updated system register** with pilot outcomes and decisions  
✓ **Staff feedback** on actual experience vs expectations  
✓ **Initial view of cost vs benefit** for each use case

**Common reasons to stop a pilot:**
- Tool doesn't fit actual workflow (looked good in demo, awkward in practice)
- Error rate remains too high despite tuning
- Staff find it more frustrating than helpful
- Integration problems too complex to resolve quickly
- Cost exceeds benefit even at best-case adoption

**Common reasons to scale:**
- Meets or exceeds success criteria
- Staff want to keep using it
- Clear path to broader adoption
- Cost-benefit case holds at larger scale
- Manageable support and governance requirements

**Common reasons to adjust and retry:**
- Core value is there but implementation needs refinement
- Different use case or workflow would work better
- Tool configuration needs adjustment
- Training approach needs improvement

---

## Stage 2: Standardise and embed guardrails (3-6 months)

**Objective:** Make AI governance and safety part of business-as-usual, not special projects.

### What to do

- **Introduce approval and risk checks for new AI projects:**
  - Expand the [AI Readiness Checklist](../governance-templates/ai-readiness-checklist.md) into standard project approval process
  - New AI initiatives can't start without basic documentation and risk assessment
  - Keep it lightweight – appropriate to risk level, not bureaucratic

- **Make the system register part of business-as-usual:**
  - Assign an owner for the register (someone senior enough to have authority)
  - Quarterly review of all active AI systems (more frequently for high-risk ones)
  - Clear process for adding new systems and updating status

- **Establish incident reporting:**
  - Deploy [AI Incident Report Form](../governance-templates/ai-incident-report-form.md)
  - Make it clear this is learning-focused, not blame-focused
  - Review incidents quarterly to identify patterns and improvement opportunities
  - Feed lessons back into training, documentation, and tool configuration

- **Publish AI use guidelines for staff:**
  - Dos and don'ts for common use cases
  - When to use AI vs when not to
  - How to review AI outputs (what to look for)
  - Where to report problems or concerns
  - Keep it to 1-2 pages, practical not theoretical

- **Example guidelines snippet:**
  - ✓ DO use AI for first drafts of routine documents
  - ✓ DO review all AI outputs before using them
  - ✓ DO report errors or concerning outputs
  - ✗ DON'T use AI for decisions about people without human review
  - ✗ DON'T copy-paste AI outputs without checking for accuracy
  - ✗ DON'T put confidential or sensitive data into unapproved AI tools

- **Set up review cadences:**
  - Monthly: Review active pilot metrics and issues
  - Quarterly: Review system register, incident reports, update risk assessments
  - Annually: Review AI use guidelines, governance framework, vendor relationships

### What "done" looks like

At the end of Stage 2, you should have:

✓ **Clear approval process** – new AI initiatives require documented risk assessment  
✓ **Maintained system register** – single source of truth for all AI use  
✓ **Working incident reporting** – staff know how to report issues, reports are actually reviewed  
✓ **Published guidelines** – staff know what's expected when using AI tools  
✓ **Regular review cadence** – governance isn't "set and forget"  
✓ **Systematic risk management** – you can answer "where do we use AI and what are the risks?"

**You should be able to answer:**
- What AI systems are we using and who owns each one?
- What risks have been identified and how are we managing them?
- How many AI incidents have we had and what did we learn?
- What are staff allowed and not allowed to do with AI tools?
- When was each system last reviewed?

---

## Stage 3: Scale what works (6-12 months)

**Objective:** Expand successful patterns while maintaining safety and learning from experience.

### What to do

- **Expand successful pilots to broader teams:**
  - Don't scale everything – focus on what clearly worked
  - Plan for 2-3x more training and support time than pilots required
  - Identify team-level champions (not just organisation-level)
  - Expect slower adoption in scaling phase than pilot phase

- **Invest in training and enablement:**
  - Develop self-service resources (written guides, video tutorials, FAQs)
  - Regular training sessions for new users (monthly or as new teams onboard)
  - "Office hours" or drop-in support sessions
  - Update training based on common issues and questions

- **Prioritise defensive and resilience use cases:**
  - Now that you've learned from productivity use cases, consider defensive ones
  - Security operations support, fraud detection, risk and compliance assistance
  - See [Safe AI Adoption - Getting Started](safe-ai-adoption-getting-started.md) for resilience-focused uses

- **Track organisation-level metrics:**
  - Monitor across four dimensions:
    - **Adoption:** How many staff are actively using tools? What percentage of eligible workflows?
    - **Value:** Time saved, quality improvements, cost savings
    - **Risk:** Incident rates and severity, staff confidence in outputs
    - **Support:** Request volumes, common issues, user satisfaction
  - Track these monthly and look for trends rather than snapshots.

### What "done" looks like

At the end of Stage 3, you should have:

✓ **Multiple teams using AI tools confidently** – not just pilot volunteers  
✓ **Clear metrics on value delivered** – can articulate ROI and benefits  
✓ **Risk managed systematically** – incidents tracked and learned from  
✓ **Training embedded** – part of onboarding and team practices  
✓ **Balanced portfolio** – productivity AND resilience use cases  
✓ **Shared knowledge** – lessons learned documented and accessible

**Warning signs to watch for:**
- High support burden not decreasing over time (indicates training or tool issues)
- Low adoption rates despite availability (change management problems)
- Increasing incident rates (inadequate controls or risky use cases)
- Staff finding workarounds (tool doesn't fit real workflow)

---

## Stage 4: Continuously assure and improve (ongoing)

**Objective:** Maintain safety and effectiveness as AI use matures and evolves.

### What to do

- **Schedule periodic assurance activities:**
  - **Quarterly reviews for high-risk systems:**
    - Review incident reports and near misses
    - Check compliance with risk controls
    - Verify system performance vs expectations
    - Update risk assessment if context changes

  - **Annual reviews for low-risk systems:**
    - Confirm system still appropriate for use case
    - Review vendor relationship and costs
    - Check for regulatory or technology changes
    - Update documentation

  - **Ad-hoc reviews when triggered:**
    - Significant incidents or near misses
    - Major system updates from vendor
    - Regulatory changes
    - Workflow or organisational changes

- **Refine guardrails based on experience:**
  - What controls are working well? What's pure overhead?
  - Where are gaps emerging?
  - What have incidents taught you?
  - Update guidelines, checklists, and processes accordingly

- **Adjust roadmap as context evolves:**
  - New regulations (track Australian AI legislation development)
  - New technology capabilities (AI is evolving rapidly)
  - Changed organisational priorities or risk appetite
  - Lessons from your experience and others'

- **Share lessons learned:**
  - Internally: cross-team learning from experiences
  - Externally: consider contributing to industry knowledge
  - Help others avoid your mistakes, learn from your successes

### What "ongoing success" looks like

In the continuous improvement stage, you should have:

✓ **Mature governance** – safety and assurance are routine, not special effort  
✓ **Learning culture** – incidents lead to improvement, not blame  
✓ **Adaptive approach** – adjusting to new regulations, technology, experience  
✓ **Balanced adoption** – moving forward deliberately, not recklessly or too cautiously  
✓ **Clear accountability** – everyone knows their role in safe AI use  
✓ **Documented track record** – can demonstrate responsible AI adoption

## Your next steps based on where you are

### If you haven't started pilots yet:

1. Review [Safe AI Adoption - Getting Started](safe-ai-adoption-getting-started.md) and complete [AI Readiness Checklist](../governance-templates/ai-readiness-checklist.md)
2. Set up your [AI System Register](../governance-templates/ai-project-register.md)
3. Evaluate 2-3 vendors using [AI Vendor Selection Guide](ai-vendor-selection-guide.md)
4. Design pilot: 5-15 people, 4-8 weeks, clear success criteria and exit conditions

### If you're running pilots now:

1. Confirm you have clear success criteria, exit conditions, and a decision timeline
2. Collect feedback weekly and document lessons as you go
3. Review change management against [AI Change Management](ai-change-management.md)
4. Update your system register with pilot status and findings

### If you're ready to scale:

1. Confirm pilot met success criteria with evidence (don't scale based on enthusiasm alone)
2. Review guardrails from [Safe AI Adoption - Getting Started](safe-ai-adoption-getting-started.md)
3. Develop training materials and identify team-level champions
4. Set up [incident reporting](../governance-templates/ai-incident-report-form.md) and plan for 2-3x more support

## Key takeaways

**The roadmap:**
- Four stages: Explore → Standardise → Scale → Assure
- Each stage has clear objectives and "done" criteria
- Don't skip stages to move faster – each builds on the previous

**Pilot design:**
- 5-15 people, 4-8 weeks
- Clear success criteria and exit conditions
- Weekly feedback, documented lessons
- Be prepared to stop pilots that aren't working

**Scaling decisions:**
- Scale based on evidence, not enthusiasm
- Plan for more support than pilots required
- Expand gradually, don't try to scale everything at once

**Ongoing assurance:**
- Regular reviews (quarterly for high-risk, annual for low-risk)
- Learn from incidents, refine controls
- Adjust to regulatory and technology changes

**Remember:**  
Perfect is the enemy of good. The goal is deliberate progress with appropriate safeguards, not flawless execution. Start small, learn fast, scale what works, and build assurance into your routine.
