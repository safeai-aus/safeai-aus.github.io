# AI Change Management

The technology is only part of the story. Getting people to actually use AI tools effectively requires deliberate change management.

Research shows that organisations with effective change management are **seven times more likely** to meet AI project objectives. Yet many organisations skip this step, announcing AI tools and expecting enthusiastic adoption.

This page provides practical guidance on managing the people and process aspects of AI adoption.

## Who this page is for

This page is for:

- Transformation and change managers leading AI rollouts
- HR teams supporting organisational change
- Project managers running AI pilots
- Team leaders preparing their teams for AI tools
- Anyone responsible for making AI adoption actually work

If you're asking "How do we get people on board with AI?" or "Why isn't our AI pilot getting traction?", this is for you.

## Why change management matters

AI adoption fails for predictable reasons:

- Staff don't understand why the change is happening or what's in it for them
- Concerns about job security aren't addressed openly
- Training focuses on "how to click buttons" rather than "how work will change"
- Early adopters get no support when they hit problems
- Feedback gets collected but nothing visibly changes

The result: Low adoption rates, workarounds, and abandoned tools despite significant investment.

**The data is clear:** Organisations that invest in change management see:

- 7x higher likelihood of meeting AI project objectives
- Faster time to value (months vs years)
- Higher sustained adoption rates
- Fewer incidents and quality issues

Change management isn't "nice to have" – it's the difference between success and expensive failure.

## Before pilots start

Getting this phase right sets up everything that follows.

### Get buy-in, don't just announce

**What doesn't work:**  
Announcing "we're piloting AI tool X starting next month" in an email and expecting enthusiasm.

**What works:**

- **Meet with affected teams early** to understand their pain points and concerns (before selecting tools)
- **Frame AI as helping with tedious work**, not replacing jobs ("We want to free you from the boring stuff so you can focus on work that requires your expertise")
- **Identify 2-3 enthusiastic early adopters** as champions who can influence peers
- **Be honest about what you don't know yet** ("We're learning together what AI is good and bad at in our environment")

**Practical approach:**  
Before announcing any pilot, hold informal conversations with 5-10 potential pilot participants. Ask: "What takes too much time in your day?" and "What concerns do you have about AI tools?" Use these insights to shape your pilot design and communication.

### Address concerns proactively

Don't wait for concerns to surface as resistance. Address them upfront:

**"Will this replace my job?"**  
→ "We're starting with tools that help you do your work better, not replace you. We're looking for time savings on routine tasks so you can focus on more valuable work. We're not planning redundancies – we're planning to redeploy time to higher-value activities."

**"How can we trust the output?"**  
→ "You won't work any differently at first – you'll review everything the AI produces. We're learning together what AI is good and bad at. You're the expert; the AI is just a first-draft tool."

**"What if it makes mistakes?"**  
→ "It will make mistakes. That's guaranteed. That's why humans review everything, and why we're starting small. We need your expertise to catch those mistakes and help us improve the system."

**"This feels like more work, not less"**  
→ "It might feel that way at first during the learning phase. We expect it to take 2-3 weeks before you see time savings. If you're not seeing benefits after [specific timeframe], tell us and we'll adjust or stop."

**"What about privacy and security?"**  
→ Be specific about data handling, where information is stored, and what controls are in place. Link to your vendor evaluation work and risk assessment.

### Set clear expectations

Before any pilot starts, participants should know:

- **What they're being asked to do** (use the tool for X tasks, provide feedback weekly)
- **How long the pilot runs** (typically 4-8 weeks for initial pilots)
- **What happens next** (we'll decide together whether to scale, adjust, or stop)
- **Who to contact** when they hit problems (name a specific person, not "IT support")
- **What success looks like** (specific metrics, not vague "productivity improvements")

---

## During pilots

This is where good change management separates successful pilots from abandoned ones.

### Communicate regularly

**Weekly check-ins** with pilot participants, not just monthly surveys:

- What's working well?
- What's frustrating?
- What questions have come up?
- What would you change?

**Share progress transparently:**

- "This week, 8 of 12 participants used the tool at least 3 times. We're seeing 25% time savings on document drafting."
- "We've identified three common errors the AI makes. Here's what we're doing about it."
- "Several people asked about X – here's the answer."

**Celebrate quick wins openly:**

- Share specific examples where the tool saved time or improved quality
- Highlight creative uses participants discovered
- Show how feedback led to changes

### Make feedback easy and act on it

**Create low-friction feedback mechanisms:**

- Dedicated Slack channel or Teams chat for quick questions
- Simple weekly feedback form (3-5 questions, takes 2 minutes)
- Regular coffee chats (informal, 15-30 minutes)
- Anonymous option for sensitive concerns

**More importantly, act on feedback visibly:**

- If people raise issues, show what changed as a result
- If you can't address a concern, explain why and what alternatives you're considering
- Close the loop: "Last week three people mentioned X – here's what we did about it"

Nothing kills engagement faster than collecting feedback that disappears into a void.

### Support different learning styles

People learn differently. Provide multiple support options:

**Written guides** for people who prefer self-directed learning:

- Step-by-step instructions with screenshots
- FAQ document that grows based on real questions
- Tips and tricks document

**Hands-on practice sessions** for people who learn by doing:

- Weekly "office hours" where people can drop in with questions
- Pair-up sessions where experienced users help newer ones
- Real work sessions where a facilitator is present to help

**Peer support and champions:**

- Identify who picks up the tool quickly and ask them to help others
- Create a "buddy system" pairing confident users with hesitant ones
- Recognise and thank people who help their peers

## When scaling

Pilot success doesn't guarantee successful scaling. This phase needs different approaches.

### Don't assume scaling will be easy

**Reality check:**

- **Pilot participants were enthusiastic volunteers**; the next wave may be skeptical
- **Early adopters tolerate rough edges**; later adopters expect polish
- **Small groups get intensive support**; larger groups need self-service resources
- **Pilots have leadership attention**; scaled tools become "just another system"

**Plan accordingly:**

- Budget **2-3x the training and support time** you needed for pilots
- Identify **team-level champions**, not just organisation-level ones
- Develop **better documentation and self-service resources** before scaling
- Expect **slower adoption** in the scaling phase

### Different stakeholders need different messages

Tailor your communication to each group:

**Frontline staff:**  
Focus on "what's in it for me" and "how does my day change"
- "This tool will save you ~30 minutes per day on X task"
- "You'll still review everything – your expertise is critical"
- "Training takes 1 hour, support is available daily"

**Middle managers:**  
Focus on team productivity, quality improvements, and how to support their teams
- "Expected productivity gain: 15-20% on routine tasks"
- "Your team will need support in weeks 2-4 as they learn"
- "Here's how to spot when someone is struggling and what to do"

**Executives:**  
Focus on strategic benefits, risk mitigation, and organisational learning
- "Successfully piloted with 15 people, scaling to 80"
- "ROI expected in 6-9 months based on pilot data"
- "Governance and monitoring processes in place"

### Track adoption, not just deployment

**Tool is installed ≠ tool is being used effectively**

Monitor:

- **Usage patterns:** Who's using it? How often? For what tasks?
- **Quality of outputs:** Are people reviewing AI outputs or blindly accepting them?
- **Support requests:** What are common issues? Are the same people repeatedly asking for help?
- **Sentiment:** How do people feel about the tool? (surveys, informal check-ins)

**Be prepared to adjust:**

- If adoption is low, dig into why (training gaps? tool doesn't fit workflow? concerns not addressed?)
- If quality issues emerge, don't just add more training – examine if the tool is actually suitable
- If certain teams thrive while others struggle, learn from the differences

## Regional and connectivity considerations

Regional Australian businesses face specific challenges when adopting AI tools. Plan for these differences:

### Infrastructure realities

**Internet connectivity:**

- Cloud-based AI tools may perform poorly in areas with limited bandwidth
- Test tools with your actual regional infrastructure before committing
- Consider hybrid solutions where some processing happens locally
- Budget for connectivity upgrades if AI adoption is a strategic priority

**What this looks like in practice:**  
A regional aged care provider tested an AI documentation tool with their slowest internet connection before committing. They discovered unacceptable lag times and negotiated a hybrid solution with local caching.

### Remote team coordination

**Challenges:**

- Pilot groups might be geographically distributed
- In-person training and support is difficult
- Different teams may have different infrastructure quality

**Approaches that work:**

- Schedule video training sessions that work across time zones
- Record training sessions for asynchronous access
- Create strong written documentation since in-person support is harder
- Use regional champions who can provide local support
- Build in extra time for remote troubleshooting

### Finding support

**Local expertise may be limited:**

- Regional areas may have fewer AI consultants or technical specialists
- Remote support and online training may be primary options
- Consider partnering with city-based providers who offer remote support

**Peer learning can fill gaps:**

- Connect with other regional businesses in your industry
- Local business chambers or regional development organisations may facilitate connections
- Online communities and forums can supplement local networks

### Regional advantages

**Don't overlook benefits:**

- Smaller, tighter teams may adopt new tools more cohesively
- Stronger relationships with suppliers may mean more hands-on support
- Less complex systems might make pilots simpler to coordinate
- Culture of "making do" can mean creative problem-solving

## Connecting to implementation guidance

Change management doesn't happen in isolation. It needs to connect to:

**Before you start:**  
Review [Safe AI Adoption - Getting Started](safe-ai-adoption-getting-started.md) to choose appropriate first use cases and avoid common mistakes.

**Vendor selection:**  
See [AI Vendor Selection Guide](ai-vendor-selection-guide.md) – vendor support quality matters enormously for change management success.

**Pilot planning and scaling:**  
See [AI Implementation Roadmap](ai-implementation-roadmap.md) for practical guidance on pilot sizing, timeframes, success criteria, and when to scale.

## Key takeaways

**Before pilots:**

- Get buy-in through conversation, not announcement
- Address concerns proactively with honest, specific answers
- Set clear expectations about timeline, commitment, and success criteria

**During pilots:**

- Communicate weekly, not monthly
- Make feedback easy and act on it visibly
- Support different learning styles

**When scaling:**

- Plan for 2-3x more support than pilots required
- Tailor messages to different stakeholder groups
- Track actual adoption, not just deployment
- Be prepared to adjust based on real usage patterns

**Regional context matters:**

- Test tools with actual infrastructure before committing
- Build strong documentation for remote support
- Leverage peer networks when local expertise is limited

**Most importantly:**  
Remember the seven times multiplier. Time invested in change management delivers returns through higher adoption, faster value, and fewer problems. It's not overhead – it's the work.
