# State & Territory AI Resources (Government & Statutory Bodies)

This page curates official, state/territory-level resources on artificial intelligence (AI) for public sector use in Australia. It focuses on whole-of-government strategies and policies, AI assurance frameworks, information/privacy guidance from statutory bodies (e.g., information commissioners, ombudsmen), and records management directives. Where education-specific positions exist, they’re included because they are often the most mature sector guidance.

> **Last verified:** 2025-08-18 (ACST). Links point only to official government or statutory sources.

## General Comment (Read First)

State and territory resources are designed to work within each jurisdiction’s legislative and policy settings. If you operate across multiple jurisdictions—or consume services from another state—start with the **local** requirements and then map to national artefacts (see **Alignment** below). Treat AI projects as **socio-technical**: combine policy, risk, privacy, security, procurement, records management, and assurance practices from the outset.

> **Note:** Policies and guidance change rapidly (especially around generative AI). Always check for the latest version and any departmental circulars or implementation notes before relying on a specific document.

## How to Use This Page

1. Identify your **jurisdiction** and applicable **agency cluster** (e.g., central DPC/DTF/Finance, Education, Records Authority, or Information Commissioner).  
2. For each item:  
   - Confirm **status/version** and whether it is **mandatory** (policy/standard) or **advisory** (guidance/toolkit).  
   - Perform or update **risk and privacy impact assessments** (PIA/DPIA) and **recordkeeping actions**.  
   - Where AI supports decisions that affect rights or benefits, apply **administrative law** duties and **human-in-the-loop** controls.  
3. If your work spans states, use the **Alignment** guidance to harmonise.

## Alignment (Important)

Many jurisdictions explicitly reference or align to the **[National Framework for the Assurance of AI in Government](https://www.finance.gov.au/government/public-data/data-and-digital-ministers-meeting/national-framework-assurance-artificial-intelligence-government)** (endorsed by Data & Digital Ministers on **21 June 2024**). When planning cross-jurisdictional work:

- Use the **local** state/territory policy and assurance artefacts to determine mandatory steps.  
- Map to the **national framework** to ensure consistent governance, documentation and transparency across borders.  
- Reconcile differences in privacy law, administrative law practice, procurement rules and records obligations by documenting **equivalences** and any **additional local controls**.  
- For agencies consuming services or models hosted in another jurisdiction, require suppliers to provide evidence of **AI assurance** against both the provider’s and customer’s frameworks, plus **PIA/DPIA**, security risk assessment and records/disposal mapping, and a clear **ADM accountability model** (human oversight, contestability, redress).
