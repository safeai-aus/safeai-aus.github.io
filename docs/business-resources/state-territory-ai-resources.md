# State & Territory AI Resources (Government & Statutory Bodies)

This page curates official, state/territory-level resources on artificial intelligence (AI) for public sector use in Australia. It focuses on whole-of-government strategies and policies, AI assurance frameworks, information/privacy guidance from statutory bodies (e.g., information commissioners, ombudsmen), and records management directives. Where education-specific positions exist, they’re included because they are often the most mature sector guidance.

> **Last verified:** 18 August 2025 (ACST). Sources are official government or statutory bodies.

## General Comment (Read First)

State and territory resources are designed to work within each jurisdiction’s legislative and policy settings. If you operate across multiple jurisdictions—or consume services from another state—start with the **local** requirements and then map to national artefacts (see **Alignment** below). Treat AI projects as **socio‑technical**: combine policy, risk, privacy, security, procurement, records management, and assurance practices from the outset.

> **Note:** Policies and guidance change rapidly (especially around generative AI). Always check for the latest version and any Departmental circulars or implementation notes before relying on a specific document.

## How to Use This Page

1. Identify your **jurisdiction** and applicable **agency cluster** (e.g., central DPC/DTF/Finance, Education, Records Authority, or Information Commissioner).
2. For each item:
   - Confirm **status/version** and whether it is **mandatory** (policy/standard) or **advisory** (guidance/toolkit).
   - Perform or update **risk and privacy impact assessments** (PIA/DPIA) and **recordkeeping actions**.
   - Where AI supports decisions that affect rights or benefits, apply **administrative law** duties and **human-in-the-loop** controls.
3. If your work spans states, use the **Alignment** guidance to harmonise.

## Alignment (Important)

- Many jurisdictions explicitly align to the **National Framework for the Assurance of AI in Government** (endorsed by Data & Digital Ministers in 2024). Where cross‑jurisdictional work is required:
  - Use the **local** state/territory policy and assurance artefacts to determine mandatory steps.
  - Map to the **national framework** to ensure consistent governance, documentation, and transparency across borders.
  - Reconcile differences in privacy law, administrative law practice, procurement rules, and records obligations by documenting **equivalences** and **additional local controls**.
- For agencies consuming services or models hosted in another jurisdiction, require suppliers to provide:
  - Evidence of **AI assurance** completed against the hosting jurisdiction’s framework **and** the customer’s local framework.
  - **PIA/DPIA**, security risk assessment, and records/disposal mapping artefacts.
  - A clear **ADM accountability model** (human oversight, contestability, redress).

## Maintenance & Contributions

- Keep this page updated with the latest versions and add sector‑specific positions (health, justice, education) when they are published by central agencies or statutory bodies.
- If you contribute, prefer **official** sources (government and statutory bodies). Include the document title, issuing body, version/date, and whether it is mandatory or guidance.
