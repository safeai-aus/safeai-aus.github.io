# Agent-Readable Resources

> **Purpose:** Machine-readable files for AI agents and automated systems to monitor SafeAI-Aus content
> **Audience:** Organisations using AI agents for compliance monitoring, governance tracking, or research | **Time:** 10 minutes

Organisations are increasingly using AI agents to monitor regulatory changes, track governance resources, and stay across updates that affect their AI posture. SafeAI-Aus publishes structured, machine-readable files so your agents can work with our content directly.

---

## Available Resources

### Updates Feed — What's Changed

**URL:** [https://safeaiaus.org/updates.json](https://safeaiaus.org/updates.json)

A structured changelog of content changes across the site. Each entry includes the date, a summary of the change, which content areas were affected, and which pages were modified.

Your agent can fetch this file, filter by content area (e.g., `governance-templates`, `safety-standards`, `business-resources`), and surface changes since a given date — without parsing HTML or checking git history.

**Example entry:**

```json
{
  "date": "2026-04-15",
  "commit": "abc1234",
  "type": "docs",
  "summary": "Update grants and tools pages from April researcher digests",
  "detail": "CRC-P Round 19 AI stream ($20M) closes 12 May 2026. DTA mandatory AI requirements for Commonwealth agencies take effect 15 June 2026. ARC Linkage 2026 round closed.",
  "tags": ["business-resources"],
  "files": ["business-resources/ai-grants-funding-australia/", "business-resources/ai-aus-tools-frameworks/"]
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `date` | When the change was made (ISO 8601) |
| `commit` | Short commit hash for traceability |
| `type` | Change type (`docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `update`) |
| `summary` | Plain-language description of the change |
| `detail` | Substantive description of what changed and why — key dates, deadlines, regulatory developments. Present when the commit includes a message body |
| `tags` | Content areas affected |
| `files` | Pages that were modified (site-relative paths) |

The feed also includes metadata — `schema_version` for format compatibility and `last_updated` so your agent can detect whether the feed has changed since its last check.

### Usage Policy — How AI Systems May Use This Content

**URL:** [https://safeaiaus.org/llms.txt](https://safeaiaus.org/llms.txt)

A Markdown policy and discovery file declaring how AI systems may use SafeAI-Aus content. It covers permissions (reading, indexing, training), attribution requirements, disclaimers and brand protection, and links agents to the site's principal guidance.

Key points:

- All content is licensed under **CC BY 4.0** — attribution required
- AI systems must not present SafeAI-Aus content as legal or regulatory advice
- AI systems must not imply SafeAI-Aus endorsement of their products

### Knowledge Base Summary — What's Here

**URL:** [https://safeaiaus.org/llms-full.txt](https://safeaiaus.org/llms-full.txt)

A structured summary of the site's content — governance templates, legislation guides, business resources, advanced AI and AGI preparedness, the C·A·G·R framework, six Australian risk scenarios, sector guidance, and curated external resources. Useful for agents that need an overview of what SafeAI-Aus covers without crawling every page.

The summary identifies scenarios as planning tools rather than predictions and preserves the uncertainty around advanced AI capabilities and timelines. Agents should also carry forward the site's legal, regulatory and government-advice disclaimers when using this material.

---

## How to Use These Resources

### Compliance Monitoring

Point your compliance agent at `/updates.json` and filter for `safety-standards` or `governance-templates` tags. When Australian legislation or standards change, the feed will show what was updated and when.

### Template Tracking

If your organisation has adopted SafeAI-Aus governance templates, your agent can check `/updates.json` for entries tagged `governance-templates` to know when templates have been revised.

### General AI Assistants

AI assistants answering questions about Australian AI governance can fetch `/llms-full.txt` for a current overview, and check `/updates.json` for recent changes that might affect their answers.

### Advanced AI Preparedness

Strategy, risk and resilience agents can use `/llms-full.txt` to locate the C·A·G·R framework, select one or more Australian risk scenarios, and find sector guidance relevant to government, business, communities or national security. The material can support workshops, assumption testing and preparedness backlogs, but must not be represented as a prediction or as definitive legal, regulatory or government advice.

## Try It Now — Copy-Paste Examples

These prompts work in Claude Code, Claude Cowork, GitHub Copilot Chat, or any AI assistant that can fetch URLs.

### Check for recent governance changes

Paste this into your AI assistant:

```
Fetch https://safeaiaus.org/updates.json and tell me what Australian AI
governance content has changed in the last 30 days. Focus on entries
tagged "governance-templates" or "safety-standards".
```

### Get an overview of available resources

```
Fetch https://safeaiaus.org/llms-full.txt and summarise what AI governance
resources are available for Australian organisations. What templates
and guides could help us get started?
```

### Monitor for changes relevant to your industry

```
Fetch https://safeaiaus.org/updates.json and check if any recent updates
affect AI risk assessment or vendor evaluation. Our organisation uses
the SafeAI-Aus risk register and vendor checklist templates.
```

### Prepare a scenario-planning exercise

```
Fetch https://safeaiaus.org/llms-full.txt and identify the advanced AI
scenario and sector guidance most relevant to our organisation. Propose
questions for a planning workshop, clearly treating the scenario as a
planning tool rather than a prediction. Flag any legal, regulatory or
government claims that participants should verify against primary sources.
```

### Set up ongoing monitoring in Claude Code

In a Claude Code session or CLAUDE.md file, you can add an instruction like:

```
When I ask about Australian AI governance updates, fetch
https://safeaiaus.org/updates.json and filter for changes since
my last check. Highlight anything tagged "safety-standards" or
"governance-templates" that might affect our AI use policy.
```

!!! tip "Works with any AI tool"
    These examples use plain English prompts. Any AI assistant that can fetch web content — Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini — can work with these files. No API keys or special setup required.

## Technical Details

- **Format:** JSON (`updates.json`), Markdown (`llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt`)
- **Update frequency:** The updates feed is regenerated on every site deployment
- **History:** The feed contains the full history of content changes — no rolling window or truncation
- **Licence:** All content is [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Attribution: *"Source: SafeAI-Aus (safeaiaus.org)"*
- **Cross-references:** Each file references the others, so discovering any one file leads to the rest

!!! info "Discovery"
    All three files are linked from each other and from this page. The `llms.txt` file is also referenced in our `robots.txt`. If your agent knows to check any one of these files, it can find the others.
