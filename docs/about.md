# About SafeAI-Aus

## Mission & Purpose

**Mission:**

To enable safe, ethical, and growth-oriented AI adoption in Australian organisations while preparing Australia for advanced AI and potential AGI transformation.

**Purpose:**

SafeAI-Aus is Australia's open-source knowledge hub providing practical tools for safe AI implementation today, and strategic frameworks for AGI preparedness tomorrow.

We help organisations of all sizes adopt AI responsibly, safely, and in compliance with Australian standards—while preparing for the long-term implications of increasingly capable AI systems.

## What We Do

SafeAI-Aus provides guidance across two horizons:

**For AI Implementation Today:**

We provide practical tools, resources, and guidelines to help Australian businesses adopt current AI systems responsibly, safeguard privacy and intellectual property, and align with both Australian and global best practices.

**For AGI Preparedness:**

We provide strategic frameworks, risk scenarios, and sector-specific guidance to help Australian organisations prepare for advanced AI and potential AGI transformation over the next 5-30 years.

By combining practical implementation guidance with strategic preparation, SafeAI-Aus aims to position Australia as a leader in both safe AI adoption and AGI readiness.

## Expanded Scope in 2026

In early 2026, SafeAI-Aus expanded its mission to include comprehensive AGI preparedness content:

- **C·A·G·R Framework** - Containment, Alignment, Governance, and Resilience strategies for advanced AI
- **AGI Risk Scenarios** - Six detailed scenarios showing how AGI risks could unfold in Australian context
- **Sector-Specific Guidance** - Strategic preparedness for government, business, and communities
- **Research Resources** - Pathways and resources for AI safety researchers

This expansion reflects the growing need for Australian organisations to prepare strategically for both current AI adoption and potential advanced AI transformation.
