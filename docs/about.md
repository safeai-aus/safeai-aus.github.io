## Mission & Purpose
**Mission:**  
To enable safe, ethical, and growth-oriented AI adoption in Australian businesses through open standards, practical tools, and collaborative knowledge-sharing.

**Purpose:**

We provide practical tools, resources, and guidelines to help businesses of all sizes adopt AI responsibly, safeguard privacy and intellectual property, and align with both Australian and global best practices.  

By combining responsible innovation with a pro-business approach, SafeAI-Aus aims to boost productivity, strengthen competitiveness, and position Australia as a leader in ethical AI adoption.
