# AI Project Register 

**Purpose¶**  
This register provides a structured way to maintain a central record of all AI initiatives within your organisation. It is designed to:  

- Ensure visibility across all AI-related projects.  
- Provide a single source of truth for governance, risk, and compliance monitoring.  
- Support decision-making through consistent project documentation and guardrail alignment.  

**When to Use**  

- At project initiation: Create a new entry for each AI initiative.  
- During project lifecycle: Update details as the project evolves (e.g., risks, model versions).  
- At review points: Use the register to assess go/no-go criteria and ensure guardrail compliance.  

**Relevant Guardrails:** 1, 2, 9, 10 (from the Australian Voluntary AI Safety Standard).
