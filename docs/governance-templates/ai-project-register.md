# AI Project Register

> **Purpose:** Central record of all AI initiatives within your organisation for governance oversight
> **Audience:** PMO, ICT, risk and governance teams | **Time:** 30 minutes setup, ongoing updates

This register provides a structured way to maintain a central record of all AI initiatives within your organisation. It is designed to:

- Ensure visibility across all AI-related projects
- Provide a single source of truth for governance, risk, and compliance monitoring
- Support decision-making through consistent project documentation and guardrail alignment

!!! info "When to Use"
    - 🎯 **At project initiation:** Create a new entry for each AI initiative
    - 🔄 **During project lifecycle:** Update details as the project evolves (e.g., risks, model versions)
    - ✅ **At review points:** Use the register to assess go/no-go criteria and ensure guardrail compliance

    **Relevant Guardrails:** 1, 2, 9, 10 (from the Australian Voluntary AI Safety Standard)

## Alignment with Australian Standards

!!! success "Standards Compliance"
    === "AI6 Essential Practices"
        ✓ **Decide who is accountable** — "Ownership & Governance" section requires "Project Owner" and "Stakeholders" for every initiative

        ✓ **Understand impacts and plan accordingly** — "Risk Assessment" section requires documentation of "Risk Level" and "Mitigations" before proceeding

        ✓ **Share essential information** — Register acts as central source of truth, sharing project details (Objectives, Timeline, Status) across the organisation

    === "Voluntary AI Safety Standard (10 Guardrails)"
        ✓ **Guardrail 1 – Accountability** — "Project Owner" field ensures specific individual accountable for AI system outputs and impacts

        ✓ **Guardrail 10 – Stakeholder engagement, safety, diversity, fairness** — "Ethics" section (Ethics Review, Bias Testing) verifies fairness and safety

        ✓ **Guardrail 9 – Record-keeping** — Register implements record-keeping by maintaining history of all AI projects, status, and key decisions

        ✓ **Guardrail 2 – Risk management** — "Risk Assessment" fields (Risk Level, Mitigations) integrate risk management into project lifecycle
