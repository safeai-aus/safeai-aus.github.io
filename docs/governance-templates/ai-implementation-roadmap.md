# AI Implementation Roadmap

> **Purpose:** Practical roadmap for running pilots, scaling successful use cases, and building ongoing assurance
> **Audience:** Project managers, transformation teams, business owners | **Time:** 20-25 minutes

You've identified good first use cases. You understand the importance of change management. You've evaluated vendors carefully.

Now you need a practical roadmap for actually implementing AI: running pilots that generate real learning, making sound scale decisions, and building assurance practices that become business-as-usual.

This page provides that roadmap with specific guidance on sizing, timeframes, success criteria, and what "done" looks like at each stage.

!!! info "Who This Page Is For"
    **Target audience:**

    - 📋 Project managers running AI pilots
    - 🔄 Transformation teams planning AI rollouts
    - 👨‍💼 Business owners moving from pilot to production
    - ❓ Anyone asking "what do we actually do, and in what order?"

    **If you're ready to move from planning to doing, this is for you.**

## The four-stage roadmap

This roadmap is intentionally lightweight. The goal is to **move forward deliberately**, not to stall waiting for perfection.

Each stage has clear objectives, typical timeframes, and "what done looks like" criteria.

### Overview

1️⃣ **Explore and pilot** (2-4 months) – Learn what works in your environment

2️⃣ **Standardise and embed guardrails** (3-6 months) – Make safety and governance routine

3️⃣ **Scale what works** (6-12 months) – Expand successful patterns

4️⃣ **Continuously assure and improve** (ongoing) – Refine based on experience

---

## 1️⃣ Stage 1: Explore and Pilot (2-4 months)

**Objective:** Run small, focused pilots that generate real learning about what AI can and can't do in your specific environment.

### What to do

- **Identify 2-3 low-risk, high-learning use cases:**
  - Review [Safe AI Adoption - Getting Started](safe-ai-adoption-getting-started.md) for good first uses
  - Choose cases that are reversible and low-stakes
  - Pick at least one that builds resilience, not just cuts cost

- **Set up your AI System Register:**
  - Use the [AI Project Register Template](../governance-templates/ai-project-register.md) to track pilots
  - Even a simple spreadsheet is fine at this stage
  - Key fields: use case, owner, risk rating, status, decisions made

- **Run small pilots with clear parameters:**
  - **Pilot group size:** 5-15 people (large enough for meaningful data, small enough to support intensively)
  - **Pilot duration:** 4-8 weeks (setup/training → regular use/feedback → evaluation; 8-12 weeks for defensive/security use cases)

  - **Success criteria examples:**
    - "Reduces document drafting time by 20% while maintaining quality"
    - "Maintains 90% accuracy with human review required for all outputs"
    - "Staff report tool is helpful, not frustrating, in week 4 survey"
    - "Zero security incidents during pilot period"
    - "80% of pilot participants want to continue using the tool"

  - **Exit conditions (when to stop):**
    - "If error rate exceeds 15% after 4 weeks of tuning"
    - "If staff satisfaction score below 3/5 after training period"
    - "If integration issues remain unresolved after 6 weeks"
    - "If cost per task exceeds current manual process cost"

- **Complete AI Readiness Checklists:**
  - Use the [AI Readiness Checklist](../governance-templates/ai-readiness-checklist.md) for each pilot
  - Document risk assessment (use [AI Risk Assessment Checklist](../governance-templates/ai-risk-assessment-checklist.md) for detailed evaluation), privacy considerations, approval
  - Lightweight but systematic

- **Capture lessons learned:**
  - Weekly pilot review meetings (30 minutes)
  - End-of-pilot retrospective (document what worked, what didn't, what surprised you)
  - Feed insights back into system register and planning

### What "done" looks like

At the end of Stage 1, you should have:

✓ **Data on whether pilots met success criteria** (yes/no with supporting metrics)  
✓ **Documented lessons learned** (what worked, what didn't, what you'd do differently)  
✓ **Clear recommendation** for each pilot (scale / adjust and retry / stop)  
✓ **Updated system register** with pilot outcomes and decisions  
✓ **Staff feedback** on actual experience vs expectations  
✓ **Initial view of cost vs benefit** for each use case

**Common reasons to stop a pilot:**
- Tool doesn't fit actual workflow (looked good in demo, awkward in practice)
- Error rate remains too high despite tuning
- Staff find it more frustrating than helpful
- Integration problems too complex to resolve quickly
- Cost exceeds benefit even at best-case adoption

**Common reasons to scale:**
- Meets or exceeds success criteria
- Staff want to keep using it
- Clear path to broader adoption
- Cost-benefit case holds at larger scale
- Manageable support and governance requirements

**Common reasons to adjust and retry:**
- Core value is there but implementation needs refinement
- Different use case or workflow would work better
- Tool configuration needs adjustment
- Training approach needs improvement

---

## 2️⃣ Stage 2: Standardise and Embed Guardrails (3-6 months)

**Objective:** Make AI governance and safety part of business-as-usual, not special projects.

### What to do

- **Introduce approval and risk checks for new AI projects:**
  - Expand the [AI Readiness Checklist](../governance-templates/ai-readiness-checklist.md) into standard project approval process
  - New AI initiatives can't start without basic documentation and risk assessment (use [AI Risk Assessment Checklist](../governance-templates/ai-risk-assessment-checklist.md))
  - Keep it lightweight – appropriate to risk level, not bureaucratic

- **Make the system register part of business-as-usual:**
  - Assign an owner for the register (someone senior enough to have authority)
  - Quarterly review of all active AI systems (more frequently for high-risk ones)
  - Clear process for adding new systems and updating status

- **Establish incident reporting:**
  - Deploy [AI Incident Report Form](../governance-templates/ai-incident-report-form.md)
  - Make it clear this is learning-focused, not blame-focused
  - Review incidents quarterly to identify patterns and improvement opportunities
  - Feed lessons back into training, documentation, and tool configuration

- **Publish AI use guidelines for staff:**
  - Use the [AI Use Policy template](../governance-templates/ai-use-policy.md) as a starting point
  - Dos and don'ts for common use cases
  - When to use AI vs when not to
  - How to review AI outputs (what to look for)
  - Where to report problems or concerns
  - Keep it to 1-2 pages, practical not theoretical

- **Example guidelines snippet:**
  - ✓ DO use AI for first drafts of routine documents
  - ✓ DO review all AI outputs before using them
  - ✓ DO report errors or concerning outputs
  - ✗ DON'T use AI for decisions about people without human review
  - ✗ DON'T copy-paste AI outputs without checking for accuracy
  - ✗ DON'T put confidential or sensitive data into unapproved AI tools

- **Set up review cadences:**
  - Monthly: Review active pilot metrics and issues
  - Quarterly: Review system register, incident reports, update risk assessments
  - Annually: Review AI use guidelines, governance framework, vendor relationships

### What "done" looks like

At the end of Stage 2, you should have:

✓ **Clear approval process** – new AI initiatives require documented risk assessment  
✓ **Maintained system register** – single source of truth for all AI use  
✓ **Working incident reporting** – staff know how to report issues, reports are actually reviewed  
✓ **Published guidelines** – staff know what's expected when using AI tools  
✓ **Regular review cadence** – governance isn't "set and forget"
✓ **Systematic risk management** – you can answer "where do we use AI and what are the risks?"

## 3️⃣ Stage 3: Scale What Works (6-12 months)

**Objective:** Expand successful patterns while maintaining safety and learning from experience.

### What to do

- **Expand successful pilots to broader teams:**
  - Don't scale everything – focus on what clearly worked
  - Plan for 2-3x more training and support time than pilots required
  - Identify team-level champions (not just organisation-level)
  - Expect slower adoption in scaling phase than pilot phase

- **Invest in training and enablement:**
  - Develop self-service resources (written guides, video tutorials, FAQs)
  - Regular training sessions for new users (monthly or as new teams onboard)
  - "Office hours" or drop-in support sessions
  - Update training based on common issues and questions

- **Prioritise defensive and resilience use cases:**
  - Now that you've learned from productivity use cases, consider defensive ones
  - Security operations support, fraud detection, risk and compliance assistance
  - See [Safe AI Adoption - Getting Started](safe-ai-adoption-getting-started.md) for resilience-focused uses

- **Track organisation-level metrics:**
  - Monitor across four dimensions:
    - **Adoption:** How many staff are actively using tools? What percentage of eligible workflows?
    - **Value:** Time saved, quality improvements, cost savings
    - **Risk:** Incident rates and severity, staff confidence in outputs
    - **Support:** Request volumes, common issues, user satisfaction
  - Track these monthly and look for trends rather than snapshots.

### What "done" looks like

At the end of Stage 3, you should have:

✓ **Multiple teams using AI tools confidently** – not just pilot volunteers  
✓ **Clear metrics on value delivered** – can articulate ROI and benefits  
✓ **Risk managed systematically** – incidents tracked and learned from  
✓ **Training embedded** – part of onboarding and team practices  
✓ **Balanced portfolio** – productivity AND resilience use cases  
✓ **Shared knowledge** – lessons learned documented and accessible

**Warning signs to watch for:**
- High support burden not decreasing over time (indicates training or tool issues)
- Low adoption rates despite availability (change management problems)
- Increasing incident rates (inadequate controls or risky use cases)
- Staff finding workarounds (tool doesn't fit real workflow)

---

## 4️⃣ Stage 4: Continuously Assure and Improve (Ongoing)

**Objective:** Maintain safety and effectiveness as AI use matures and evolves.

### What to do

- **Schedule periodic assurance activities:**
  - **Quarterly reviews for high-risk systems:**
    - Review incident reports and near misses
    - Check compliance with risk controls
    - Verify system performance vs expectations
    - Update risk assessment if context changes

  - **Annual reviews for low-risk systems:**
    - Confirm system still appropriate for use case
    - Review vendor relationship and costs
    - Check for regulatory or technology changes
    - Update documentation

  - **Ad-hoc reviews when triggered:**
    - Significant incidents or near misses
    - Major system updates from vendor
    - Regulatory changes
    - Workflow or organisational changes

- **Refine guardrails based on experience:**
  - What controls are working well? What's pure overhead?
  - Where are gaps emerging?
  - What have incidents taught you?
  - Update guidelines, checklists, and processes accordingly

- **Adjust roadmap as context evolves:**
  - New regulations (track Australian AI legislation development)
  - New technology capabilities (AI is evolving rapidly)
  - Changed organisational priorities or risk appetite
  - Lessons from your experience and others'

- **Share lessons learned:**
  - Internally: cross-team learning from experiences
  - Externally: consider contributing to industry knowledge
  - Help others avoid your mistakes, learn from your successes

### What "ongoing success" looks like

In the continuous improvement stage, you should have:

✓ **Mature governance** – safety and assurance are routine, not special effort  
✓ **Learning culture** – incidents lead to improvement, not blame  
✓ **Adaptive approach** – adjusting to new regulations, technology, experience  
✓ **Balanced adoption** – moving forward deliberately, not recklessly or too cautiously  
✓ **Clear accountability** – everyone knows their role in safe AI use  
✓ **Documented track record** – can demonstrate responsible AI adoption

## Your next steps

**Haven't started pilots?** Review [Safe AI Adoption - Getting Started](safe-ai-adoption-getting-started.md), complete [AI Readiness Checklist](../governance-templates/ai-readiness-checklist.md), set up [AI System Register](../governance-templates/ai-project-register.md), and evaluate vendors using [AI Vendor Evaluation Checklist](ai-vendor-evaluation-checklist.md).

**Running pilots now?** Confirm clear success criteria and exit conditions. Collect feedback weekly. Review [AI Change Management](ai-change-management.md). Update your system register.

**Ready to scale?** Confirm pilot met success criteria with evidence. Develop training materials and identify champions. Set up [incident reporting](../governance-templates/ai-incident-report-form.md) and plan for 2-3x more support.

---

## Key Takeaways

!!! success "Implementation Principles"
    **Four stages:** Explore → Standardise → Scale → Assure. Each has clear objectives and "done" criteria. Don't skip stages.

    **Pilot design:** 5-15 people, 4-8 weeks. Clear success criteria and exit conditions. Be prepared to stop what isn't working.

    **Scaling:** Scale based on evidence, not enthusiasm. Plan for 2-3x more support. Expand gradually.

    **Ongoing:** Regular reviews (quarterly for high-risk, annual for low-risk). Learn from incidents. Adjust to regulatory changes.

    **Remember:** Perfect is the enemy of good. Start small, learn fast, scale what works, and build assurance into your routine.
