# AI Risks by Industry (Australia)

This page provides example AI-related risks tailored to fourteen major Australian industries, with particular emphasis on sectors with significant SME representation.

These examples help businesses identify context-specific risks before adapting them into their own AI risk registers. Each table includes example risks, brief descriptions, and potential impacts. Organisations can extend these tables with columns for control measures, likelihood, residual risk, and ownership to match the main [AI Risk Register Template](ai-risk-register.md).

**Industry Selection:** The industries featured represent a mix of large enterprise sectors (mining, finance, energy) and SME-dominant sectors (retail, hospitality, professional services, construction) to reflect the diverse Australian business landscape. Priority has been given to sectors with active AI adoption and clear regulatory considerations.

## Using These Risk Examples

**For SMEs:**
- Start with 3-5 risks most relevant to your current or planned AI use
- Adapt the descriptions to your specific systems and context
- Add your own control measures and assign ownership
- Review quarterly as your AI use evolves

**For Larger Organisations:**
- Use these as a starting point for comprehensive risk registers
- Expand with additional columns (likelihood, controls, residual risk, review dates)
- Integrate with existing enterprise risk management frameworks
- Consider cross-referencing with the [Australian Voluntary AI Safety Standard](../safety-standards/voluntary-ai-safety-standard-10-guardrails.md)

**Important Note:** These examples represent common risk patterns but are not exhaustive. Every organisation should conduct its own risk assessment considering its specific AI applications, data, stakeholders and regulatory environment.
