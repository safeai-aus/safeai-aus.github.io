# AI Risk Assessment Checklist

This checklist helps Australian businesses consider key risks when planning, developing, or using AI systems. It aligns with national guardrails, ethical principles, and relevant international standards.  

It can be used both as a **project planning tool** (to assess risks before deployment) and as part of an organisation’s **risk management framework** (for routine compliance checks and ongoing oversight).  

---

## How to Use This Checklist
- **When to use:**  
  - Before starting an AI project (planning and design stage).  
  - Before deploying a new AI system into live use.  
  - During regular reviews of an existing AI system.  
  - As part of routine compliance checks within your organisation’s risk management framework.  

- **How to use:**  
  - Work through each section and record your responses.  
  - Treat the depth of responses as proportional to the impact: higher-risk projects need more detailed consideration.  
  - Use plain language—responses don’t need to be long, but they should show how the risk has been thought about and addressed.  
  - Keep the completed checklist as part of your project records.

## 1. Project Overview & Purpose
- [ ] Have you clearly described what the AI system will do?  
- [ ] Does it provide a clear benefit (e.g. efficiency, customer service, staff support)?  
- [ ] Is the benefit aligned with your organisation’s goals?

---

## 2. Risk Classification
- [ ] If the AI fails or gives wrong results, could it cause harm (e.g. financial, reputational, safety)?  
- [ ] Based on that, is the **project or system** **Low / Medium / High** impact?  
*(Example: a website chatbot = low; staff rostering = medium; automated loan approvals = high).*

## 3. Data Governance & Privacy/IP
- [ ] Does the system use personal data? If yes, are you complying with the **Privacy Act 1988 (APPs)**?  
- [ ] Do you know who owns the training data and outputs (IP rights)?  
- [ ] Are you keeping only the data you really need (data minimisation)?  
- [ ] Can you track where the data came from (provenance)?  

*Sources: Privacy Act 1988 (APPs); Guardrails 4 & 7; ISO/IEC 23894*  

---

## 4. Security & Reliability
- [ ] Have you taken basic cybersecurity steps (e.g. strong passwords, access controls, software updates)?  
- [ ] Is the system resilient (will it keep working under normal load)?  
- [ ] Do you have a backup or manual process if the AI goes offline or makes repeated mistakes?

## 5. Human Oversight & Accountability
- [ ] Is a specific person responsible for this AI system?  
- [ ] Have you identified **human-in-the-loop checkpoints** where oversight is required?  
- [ ] Can staff override or contest AI decisions if needed?  
- [ ] Can customers or staff raise concerns easily?  

*Sources: Guardrail 8; Australian AI Ethics Principle: Accountability*  

---

## 6. Testing & Evaluation
- [ ] Have you tested the AI on real-world examples before going live?  
- [ ] Have you checked for bias, errors, or poor accuracy?  
- [ ] Have you recorded your testing results (even in a simple log or spreadsheet)?  

*Sources: Guardrail 6; NIST AI Risk Management Framework*  

---

## 7. Transparency & Explainability
- [ ] Can you explain, in plain English, how the system works and why it gives certain results?  
- [ ] Have you told staff or customers when they are interacting with AI (not a human)?  
- [ ] Are user instructions or limitations clearly documented?  

*Sources: Guardrail 9; OECD AI Principles*  

---

## 8. Ongoing Monitoring & Review
- [ ] How often will you review the system? (e.g. monthly, quarterly)  
- [ ] Do you have a way to track problems or incidents?  
- [ ] Will you retrain or update the system when data or business needs change?  

*Sources: Guardrail 10; ISO/IEC 42001*
