# AI Vendor Evaluation Checklist 

Selecting the right AI vendor is a critical step in managing risk and ensuring safe, ethical, and productive use of AI in your business. This checklist helps Australian organisations assess potential AI vendors against industry standards, legal requirements, and best practices.  

Using this evaluation process supports stronger AI governance by:  
- Reducing risks from unverified or non-compliant AI products.  
- Ensuring transparency, accountability, and security in AI procurement.  
- Building trust with customers, regulators, and partners.  

This checklist can be used as part of your organisation’s AI governance framework when:  
- Onboarding a new AI vendor.  
- Renewing or extending existing vendor contracts.  
- Reviewing AI products that have undergone significant updates.  

Work through each section, seek evidence from the vendor, and record your findings. Where needed, consult legal, risk, or IT experts before approving an AI vendor.
