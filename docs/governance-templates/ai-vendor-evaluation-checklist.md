# AI Vendor Evaluation Checklist

Selecting the right AI vendor is critical for managing risk and ensuring safe, ethical, and productive use of AI in your business. This checklist helps Australian organisations assess potential AI vendors against industry standards, legal requirements, and best practices.

Using this evaluation process supports stronger AI governance by:

- Reducing risks from unverified or non-compliant AI products
- Ensuring transparency, accountability, and security in AI procurement
- Building trust with customers, regulators, and partners

This checklist can be used as part of your organisation's AI governance framework when:

- Onboarding a new AI vendor
- Renewing or extending existing vendor contracts
- Reviewing AI products that have undergone significant updates

Work through each section, seek evidence from the vendor, and record your findings. Where needed, consult legal, risk, or IT experts before approving an AI vendor.

## Build vs Buy: Before You Evaluate

Before evaluating vendors, confirm that buying is the right approach.

### Almost always buy for first AI uses

For Australian SMEs, buying pre-built AI solutions is usually the right choice:

- **Faster to pilot:** Weeks vs months to get started
- **Lower costs:** $200-3,000/month subscription vs $30,000-100,000+ development
- **Easier to change:** Cancel subscription vs abandon custom code
- **Vendor handles updates:** Security patches, model improvements, compliance updates
- **Market proven:** Other organisations have tested and refined the approach

### Consider building only when:

- Your use case is truly unique to your industry with no off-the-shelf options
- You have existing development capability with spare capacity (not hiring contractors)
- You've thoroughly evaluated off-the-shelf tools and they genuinely don't fit
- You're past the pilot stage with clear, proven requirements from successful vendor tools
- You have budget for both initial development and ongoing maintenance

**Reality check:** Even large organisations with substantial tech teams often buy rather than build for AI tools. The technology is evolving too quickly, and maintaining custom AI systems requires significant ongoing effort.

## Critical Red Flags

**Stop or proceed with extreme caution if a vendor:**

### 1. Can't explain how their AI works
Gets defensive when asked about decision-making, hides behind "proprietary algorithms," or can't explain it in plain language.

**Why it matters:** You need to understand AI behaviour well enough to know when to trust it and how to explain it to regulators or customers.

### 2. Makes unrealistic promises
Claims "100% accuracy," "fully automated from day one," "no human oversight needed," "works perfectly out of the box," or "guaranteed ROI in 30 days."

**Why it matters:** AI systems have limitations and require tuning. Unrealistic promises indicate the vendor doesn't understand their own technology or is being deliberately misleading.

### 3. Dismisses your concerns
Brushes off questions about bias, treats privacy concerns as paranoia, dismisses error rates as "not a real problem," or suggests your requirements are unreasonable.

**Why it matters:** If vendors won't take your concerns seriously during sales, they definitely won't during implementation or support.

### 4. Has no Australian customer references
Cannot provide Australian customers, especially in your sector. Only offers international references.

**Why it matters:** Australian regulatory environment, business practices, and language nuances matter. Vendors without Australian experience may not understand local compliance requirements.

### 5. Is unclear about data handling
Vague about data storage location, can't explain who accesses your data, unclear about data usage (training models? sharing?), or has no clear data export/deletion process.

**Why it matters:** Data sovereignty, privacy compliance, and vendor lock-in risks all depend on clear data handling terms.

### 6. Demands heavy lock-in with no trial
Requires 12+ month contracts with no trial option, high switching costs or data export fees, proprietary data formats, or no clear cancellation process.

**Why it matters:** You need room to learn and adjust. Long lock-in periods create risk, especially for first AI uses.

### 7. Lacks relevant certifications
No ISO 27001, SOC 2, or industry-specific certifications relevant to your needs.

**Why it matters:** These certifications indicate basic security and privacy practices are in place. For sectors like health or finance, specific certifications may be required.

## How this template implements AI6 and VAISS

### AI6 practices supported by this template

- **Share essential information** – Sections 1-2 ("Vendor Information" and "Product/Service Description") ensure essential information about external AI systems is captured
- **Measure and manage risks** – Sections 5 and 12 ("Security Practices" and "Financial & Commercial Assessment") help measure specific vendor-related risks
- **Test and monitor** – Section 6 ("Model Development & Testing") asks for evidence of the vendor's own testing and validation processes

### VAISS guardrails supported by this template

- **Guardrail 8 – Supply chain accountability** – This entire checklist is the primary mechanism for implementing supply chain accountability, ensuring vendors meet safety standards
- **Guardrail 3 – Data protection & security** – Sections 4 and 5 ("Data Governance" and "Security Practices") verify that vendors have appropriate data and security controls
- **Guardrail 6 – Testing & assurance** – Section 6 checks that the vendor has adequately tested their model for bias, robustness, and accuracy
- **Guardrail 1 – Accountability** – Section 9 ("Contractual Safeguards") ensures legal and operational accountability is defined in vendor contracts
