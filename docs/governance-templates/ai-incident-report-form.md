# AI Incident Report Form 

AI systems can create new opportunities for businesses, but they also introduce risks — from unexpected errors and harmful outputs to privacy breaches and security incidents.  

Having a clear process for recording and reporting AI incidents is an essential part of your organisation’s risk and security management practices. This ensures that issues are identified quickly, lessons are learned, and safeguards are improved.  

Use this form whenever an AI-related incident occurs in your business. The information you capture will help:  

- Contain and mitigate risks early.  
- Protect staff, customers, and your organisation’s reputation.  
- Meet your obligations under Australian law and AI guardrails.  
- Build trust by showing responsible use of AI.
