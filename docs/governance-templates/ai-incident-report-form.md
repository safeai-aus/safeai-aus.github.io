# AI Incident Report Form 

AI systems can create new opportunities for businesses, but they also introduce risks — from unexpected errors and harmful outputs to privacy breaches and security incidents.  

Having a clear process for recording and reporting AI incidents is an essential part of your organisation’s **risk management** and **security management** practices. This ensures that issues are identified quickly, lessons are learned, and safeguards are improved.  

Use this form whenever an AI-related incident occurs in your business. The information you capture will help:  
- Contain and mitigate risks early.  
- Protect staff, customers, and your organisation’s reputation.  
- Meet your obligations under Australian law and AI guardrails.  
- Build trust by showing responsible use of AI.
