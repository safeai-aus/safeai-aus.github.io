# Governance Templates

> **Purpose:** Practical, ready-to-use templates for safe AI adoption in Australian organisations
> **Audience:** Leadership, governance, compliance, and technical teams | **Status:** Free & open-source

Practical, open-source templates to help Australian businesses implement safe, responsible, and effective AI.

These documents are designed as a **baseline AI governance toolkit**: they provide a set of lightweight, practical policies and forms that can be adapted to your organisation's context.

!!! success "Standards Alignment"
    Together, these templates support compliance with the **Voluntary AI Safety Standard (VAISS) - 10 Guardrails** and align with international frameworks:

    - [ISO/IEC 42001:2023 Artificial Intelligence Management System (AIMS)](https://www.iso.org/standard/81230.html)
    - [NIST AI Risk Management Framework 1.0](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework)
    - Australian Government's [Voluntary AI Safety Standard](https://www.industry.gov.au/publications/voluntary-ai-safety-standard)

---

!!! tip "Why Use These Templates?"
    - ✅ **Consistency** — A common set of documents reduces gaps and overlaps across projects
    - ✅ **Risk reduction** — Guardrail alignment ensures that risks (data, security, accountability, bias) are addressed
    - ✅ **Efficiency** — SMEs and larger organisations alike can use these without building frameworks from scratch
    - ✅ **Transparency** — Provides evidence of responsible AI practices to customers, partners, and regulators

## How to Use These Templates

!!! tip "Implementation Best Practices"
    **Adapt locally** — These are starting points. Tailor them to your organisation's size, industry, and regulatory obligations.

    **Integrate** — Templates should sit within existing governance, risk, and compliance processes (e.g. risk registers, change management).

    **Iterate** — AI is fast-moving. Review and update these documents regularly as your AI maturity grows.

**Common questions:**

??? question "Are these templates legally binding?"
    No. These are guidance templates to help you establish your own policies. You should adapt them to your context and may wish to seek legal or compliance advice before formal adoption.

??? question "Do I need all templates?"
    Start with the Readiness Checklist, Use Policy, and Risk Assessment. Add others as your AI program matures.

??? question "How do I know which template to use first?"
    Follow the "Getting Started" implementation path above, or use the Readiness Checklist to identify your specific needs.
