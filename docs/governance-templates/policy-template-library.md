# Policy & Template Library

Practical, open-source templates to help Australian businesses implement safe, responsible, and effective AI.

These documents are designed as a **baseline AI governance toolkit**: they provide a set of lightweight, practical policies and forms that can be adapted to your organisation’s context. 

Together, they support compliance with the **Voluntary AI Safety Standard (10 Guardrails)** and align with international frameworks including:  

- [ISO/IEC 42001:2023 Artificial Intelligence Management System (AIMS)](https://www.iso.org/standard/81230.html)  
- [NIST AI Risk Management Framework 1.0](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework)  
- Australian Government’s [Voluntary AI Safety Standard](https://www.industry.gov.au/publications/voluntary-ai-safety-standard)

## Why use these templates?

- **Consistency:** A common set of documents reduces gaps and overlaps across projects.  
- **Risk reduction:** Guardrail alignment ensures that risks (data, security, accountability, bias) are addressed.  
- **Efficiency:** SMEs and larger organisations alike can use these without building frameworks from scratch.  
- **Transparency:** Provides evidence of responsible AI practices to customers, partners, and regulators.

## How to use

- **Adapt locally:** These are starting points — adapt them to your organisation’s size, industry, and regulatory obligations.  
- **Integrate:** Templates should sit within existing governance, risk, and compliance processes (e.g. risk registers, change management).  
- **Iterate:** AI is fast-moving. Review and update these documents regularly as your AI maturity grows.
