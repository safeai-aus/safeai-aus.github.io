# AI Risk Register Template

> **Purpose:** Central tracking tool for identifying, assessing, and managing AI-related risks
> **Audience:** Risk managers, governance teams, compliance officers | **Time:** 30-45 minutes setup, ongoing updates

This register provides a starting point for organisations to identify, assess, and manage risks associated with the use of AI. Each entry includes example control measures, while columns for likelihood, residual risk, and risk owner are left blank for organisations to complete based on their context.

---

!!! tip "How to Use This Template"
    1. Connect this AI risk register to your organisation's existing Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) processes and enterprise risk register
    2. Review the example risks below (common AI-related risks for Australian businesses)
    3. Tailor risks to your organisation's industry, scale, and regulatory environment
    4. Assess likelihood and residual risk using your established risk rating framework
    5. Assign risk owners to relevant leaders or teams for ongoing monitoring
    6. Implement control measures starting with the examples provided, then expand with your own policies and oversight mechanisms
    7. Update regularly as AI tools, regulations, and use cases evolve

## AI Risk Register

| **Risk ID** | **Risk Name** | **Description** | **Potential Impact** | **Example Control Measures** | **Likelihood** | **Residual Risk** | **Risk Owner** |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------------|------------------------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| R1 | **Regulatory Non-Compliance** | Use of AI systems that breach Australian privacy law, consumer protection, workplace legislation, or sector-specific obligations. | Legal penalties, reputational damage, loss of customer trust, forced system shutdown. | Conduct legal/ethical reviews of AI use; align with Privacy Act and sector standards; maintain audit trail of AI decisions. | | | |
| R2 | **Bias and Discrimination** | AI models embed or amplify bias in decision-making (e.g. hiring, credit, customer service). | Discrimination claims, HR disputes, reputational harm, reduced fairness and equity. | Implement fairness testing; diverse training data; human-in-the-loop for sensitive decisions; regular bias audits. | | | |
| R3 | **Data Security & Privacy Breach** | Sensitive personal or business data used in AI training or prompts leaks through insecure systems. | Regulatory fines, lawsuits, cyber incidents, erosion of customer confidence. | Apply data minimisation; use approved secure platforms; encryption; staff training on safe data handling. | | | |
| R4 | **Misinformation & Hallucination** | AI systems generate inaccurate, misleading, or fabricated outputs presented as factual. | Misguided decisions, reputational risk, financial loss, reduced trust in AI. | Require human review of critical outputs; maintain verification steps; label AI-generated content clearly. | | | |
| R5 | **Vendor Lock-In & Dependency** | Heavy reliance on a single AI provider without clear exit strategies. | Rising costs, limited flexibility, exposure if provider fails or withdraws service. | Diversify providers; contract clauses for portability; maintain internal capability; develop contingency plans. | | | |
| R6 | **Workforce & Cultural Impact** | Poorly managed AI adoption leads to fear, resistance, or job displacement concerns. | Staff disengagement, loss of talent, industrial relations challenges. | Communicate openly with staff; provide reskilling programs; include employees in AI adoption planning. | | | |
| R7 | **Operational Failures** | Over-automation or inadequate human oversight leads to business process failures. | Service disruption, financial loss, customer dissatisfaction. | Define human oversight points; fallback processes; robust testing before deployment. | | | |
| R8 | **Reputational Backlash** | Public perception that AI is unsafe, unethical, or misaligned with community expectations. | Negative media coverage, brand damage, customer attrition. | Publish responsible AI policy; adopt transparent communication; align with community values; independent review boards. | | | |

## How to Assess AI Risk

!!! info "Assessment Lenses"
    When assessing AI risks in your organisation, consider these dimensions:

    - 🏢 **Business Context** – Where is AI being used (customer-facing, internal, back-office)? How critical are these processes to operations or reputation?
    - ⚖️ **Legal & Regulatory Obligations** – Which laws, industry codes, or standards apply (e.g. Privacy Act, workplace law, consumer law, sector-specific regulators)?
    - 🔒 **Data Sensitivity** – What kind of data is being processed (personal, confidential, intellectual property)? Could exposure cause harm?
    - 👥 **Human Impact** – How could staff, customers, or communities be affected by errors, bias, or automation decisions?
    - 🤖 **Technology Reliability** – What are the limits of the AI model? How often are errors or hallucinations likely to occur, and in what context?
    - 📊 **Governance & Oversight** – Who is responsible for approving, monitoring, and reviewing AI systems? Are there escalation paths when risks materialise?
    - 🌐 **Reputation & Trust** – How might customers, employees, regulators, or the media react if something goes wrong?

**A Practical Approach:**

1. **Identify** the AI system, its purpose, and stakeholders impacted
2. **Analyse** risks across the above dimensions
3. **Rate** each risk using your organisation's existing risk rating framework (likelihood × consequence), ensuring consistency with enterprise risk management
4. **Mitigate** by implementing appropriate controls (technical, procedural, cultural)
5. **Monitor & Review** regularly, as both technology and regulation evolve rapidly
6. **Integrate** into the broader GRC processes — AI risks should sit within the same governance and reporting mechanisms as other strategic, financial, and operational risks

## How the Risk Register Process Supports the Guardrails

The risk register process is not just a compliance exercise — it is a practical way to demonstrate alignment with the **Australian Government’s Voluntary AI Safety Standard**. By identifying, analysing, and monitoring AI risks, organisations strengthen their ability to act consistently with the 10 guardrails.  

- It ensures AI adoption is **human-centred, fair, and respectful of wellbeing**.  
- It embeds **privacy, security, reliability, and safety** considerations into day-to-day governance.  
- It supports **transparency, accountability, and contestability** by assigning risk owners and documenting controls.  
- It reinforces **compliance with law** and integrates AI into existing GRC frameworks.  
- It encourages **responsible design, deployment, and ongoing monitoring**, ensuring AI adoption is beneficial and sustainable.

## Alignment with Australian Standards

!!! success "Standards Compliance"
    === "AI6 Essential Practices"
        ✓ **Measure and manage risks** — This register is the core tool for ongoing risk management, tracking likelihood, impact, and control measures

        ✓ **Decide who is accountable** — "Risk Owner" column ensures every risk is assigned to a specific individual

        ✓ **Share essential information** — Central documentation shares safety information with stakeholders and governance bodies

    === "Voluntary AI Safety Standard (10 Guardrails)"
        ✓ **Guardrail 2 – Risk management** — Provides structure for documenting risk assessments and mitigation effectiveness

        ✓ **Guardrail 1 – Accountability** — "Risk Owner" assignment supports clear accountability for risk outcomes

        ✓ **Guardrail 9 – Record-keeping** — Serves as formal record of the organisation's risk landscape and management efforts

        ✓ **Guardrail 7 – Monitoring impacts** — "Residual Risk" and review columns support ongoing monitoring of risk levels
