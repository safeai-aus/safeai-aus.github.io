# AI Risk Register Template

This register provides a starting point for organisations to identify, assess, and manage risks associated with the use of AI. Each entry includes example control measures, while columns for likelihood, residual risk, and risk owner are left blank for organisations to complete based on their context.

---

## How to Use This Page

1. **Connect to your broader risk framework** – This AI risk register should not stand alone. Integrate it into your organisation’s existing **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) processes**, enterprise risk register, and risk appetite statements.  
2. **Review the example risks** – These are common AI-related risks relevant to many Australian businesses.  
3. **Tailor to your organisation** – Add, remove, or adjust risks so the register reflects your industry, scale, and regulatory environment.  
4. **Assess likelihood and residual risk** – Use your organisation’s established risk rating framework to complete the blank fields.  
5. **Assign risk owners** – Allocate responsibility to relevant leaders or teams to ensure ongoing monitoring.  
6. **Implement control measures** – Use the example measures provided as a starting point, and expand with your own policies, technologies, or oversight mechanisms.  
7. **Update regularly** – As AI tools, regulations, and organisational use cases evolve, revisit this register to keep it accurate and effective.

## AI Risk Register

| **Risk ID** | **Risk Name** | **Description** | **Potential Impact** | **Example Control Measures** | **Likelihood** | **Residual Risk** | **Risk Owner** |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------------|------------------------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| R1 | **Regulatory Non-Compliance** | Use of AI systems that breach Australian privacy law, consumer protection, workplace legislation, or sector-specific obligations. | Legal penalties, reputational damage, loss of customer trust, forced system shutdown. | Conduct legal/ethical reviews of AI use; align with Privacy Act and sector standards; maintain audit trail of AI decisions. | | | |
| R2 | **Bias and Discrimination** | AI models embed or amplify bias in decision-making (e.g. hiring, credit, customer service). | Discrimination claims, HR disputes, reputational harm, reduced fairness and equity. | Implement fairness testing; diverse training data; human-in-the-loop for sensitive decisions; regular bias audits. | | | |
| R3 | **Data Security & Privacy Breach** | Sensitive personal or business data used in AI training or prompts leaks through insecure systems. | Regulatory fines, lawsuits, cyber incidents, erosion of customer confidence. | Apply data minimisation; use approved secure platforms; encryption; staff training on safe data handling. | | | |
| R4 | **Misinformation & Hallucination** | AI systems generate inaccurate, misleading, or fabricated outputs presented as factual. | Misguided decisions, reputational risk, financial loss, reduced trust in AI. | Require human review of critical outputs; maintain verification steps; label AI-generated content clearly. | | | |
| R5 | **Vendor Lock-In & Dependency** | Heavy reliance on a single AI provider without clear exit strategies. | Rising costs, limited flexibility, exposure if provider fails or withdraws service. | Diversify providers; contract clauses for portability; maintain internal capability; develop contingency plans. | | | |
| R6 | **Workforce & Cultural Impact** | Poorly managed AI adoption leads to fear, resistance, or job displacement concerns. | Staff disengagement, loss of talent, industrial relations challenges. | Communicate openly with staff; provide reskilling programs; include employees in AI adoption planning. | | | |
| R7 | **Operational Failures** | Over-automation or inadequate human oversight leads to business process failures. | Service disruption, financial loss, customer dissatisfaction. | Define human oversight points; fallback processes; robust testing before deployment. | | | |
| R8 | **Reputational Backlash** | Public perception that AI is unsafe, unethical, or misaligned with community expectations. | Negative media coverage, brand damage, customer attrition. | Publish responsible AI policy; adopt transparent communication; align with community values; independent review boards. | | | |

## How to Assess AI Risk

When assessing AI risks in your organisation, consider the following lenses:  

- **Business Context** – Where is AI being used (customer-facing, internal, back-office)? How critical are these processes to operations or reputation?  
- **Legal & Regulatory Obligations** – Which laws, industry codes, or standards apply (e.g. Privacy Act, workplace law, consumer law, sector-specific regulators)?  
- **Data Sensitivity** – What kind of data is being processed (personal, confidential, intellectual property)? Could exposure cause harm?  
- **Human Impact** – How could staff, customers, or communities be affected by errors, bias, or automation decisions?  
- **Technology Reliability** – What are the limits of the AI model? How often are errors or hallucinations likely to occur, and in what context?  
- **Governance & Oversight** – Who is responsible for approving, monitoring, and reviewing AI systems? Are there escalation paths when risks materialise?  
- **Reputation & Trust** – How might customers, employees, regulators, or the media react if something goes wrong?  

### A Practical Approach
1. **Identify** the AI system, its purpose, and stakeholders impacted.  
2. **Analyse** risks across the above dimensions.  
3. **Rate** each risk using your organisation’s **existing risk rating framework** (likelihood × consequence), ensuring consistency with enterprise risk management.  
4. **Mitigate** by implementing appropriate controls (technical, procedural, cultural).  
5. **Monitor & Review** regularly, as both technology and regulation evolve rapidly.  
6. **Integrate** into the broader **GRC processes** — AI risks should sit within the same governance and reporting mechanisms as other strategic, financial, and operational risks.

## How the Risk Register Process Supports the Guardrails

The risk register process is not just a compliance exercise — it is a practical way to demonstrate alignment with the **Australian Government’s Voluntary AI Safety Standard**. By identifying, analysing, and monitoring AI risks, organisations strengthen their ability to act consistently with the 10 guardrails.  

- It ensures AI adoption is **human-centred, fair, and respectful of wellbeing**.  
- It embeds **privacy, security, reliability, and safety** considerations into day-to-day governance.  
- It supports **transparency, accountability, and contestability** by assigning risk owners and documenting controls.  
- It reinforces **compliance with law** and integrates AI into existing GRC frameworks.  
- It encourages **responsible design, deployment, and ongoing monitoring**, ensuring AI adoption is beneficial and sustainable.
