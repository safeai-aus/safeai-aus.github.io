# AI Readiness Checklist

This checklist helps Australian businesses decide if they are ready to adopt AI safely, responsibly, and effectively.  
It reflects the **Voluntary AI Safety Standard (10 Guardrails)** released by the Australian Government and is consistent with international frameworks such as **ISO/IEC 42001:2023** and the **NIST AI Risk Management Framework**.

Tick the boxes that apply to your organisation. A higher score means greater readiness.
