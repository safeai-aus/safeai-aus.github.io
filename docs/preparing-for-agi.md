# Preparing for AGI

**What happens when AI systems become far more capable than today's tools—and those systems are embedded in defence, critical infrastructure, finance, health, and media?**

Most AI guidance focuses on near-term adoption: productivity tools, governance frameworks, compliance. That work is essential and forms the core of SafeAI-Aus. But organisations also need to prepare for advanced AI transformation over the next 5-15 years.

This section provides practical guidance for that preparation. We address risks that span both near-term advanced AI systems and potential longer-term AGI (Artificial General Intelligence—AI matching human capabilities across virtually all domains). Whether you're in government, business, or community organisations, you'll find scenarios, frameworks, and guidance specific to Australia's context.

**Time to explore:** 30-45 minutes | **Audience:** Government, business leaders, community organisations

## Why Australia needs this

Australia faces a distinctive risk profile: we're a small, advanced economy that imports frontier AI from the US and China but experiences full impact when those systems are deployed in our critical infrastructure.

**Key characteristics:**

- **Small population (27 million)** means less redundancy when systems fail
- **Geographic isolation** creates vulnerabilities (long supply chains) but also some resilience
- **Five Eyes partnerships** provide intelligence access and influence on allied approaches
- **Strong democratic institutions** enable accountability even for classified systems
- **Concentrated sectors** (banking, media, energy) create systemic risks
- **World-class universities** can partner on evaluation and research
- **Pragmatic culture** in technology policy supports evidence-based approaches

This section asks: given this context—not the US, UK, or EU context—what should Australia do?

## How to use this section

**Start with scenarios if you want:**

- Concrete examples of what could go wrong
- Tabletop exercise materials for your organisation
- Risk assessment inputs for planning processes
- Shared language for discussing advanced AI risks

**Start with the framework if you want:**

- Systematic approach to AGI preparedness
- Understanding of defence-in-depth strategy
- Analytical tools for evaluating AI systems
- Integration with existing risk management

**Most organisations benefit from both:** scenarios illustrate risks, framework provides structure for response.

## Two parallel challenges: Safety AND governance

These challenges exist whether AGI is perfectly safe or catastrophically dangerous.

!!! tip "Important: Governance challenges persist even with safe AGI"
    **Even if AGI is perfectly aligned and technically safe**, Australia still faces profound challenges:

    - **Power concentration:** Who controls transformative technology? A handful of companies or nations with safe AGI still wield unprecedented influence
    - **Economic transformation:** How are productivity gains distributed? Safe AGI that automates knowledge work still transforms employment and meaning
    - **Democratic governance:** Who decides how AGI is used? Technical safety doesn't ensure democratic input or community values
    - **Resilience:** Dependencies on AI systems create vulnerability to disruption, even when systems work as intended

    **This section addresses both catastrophic safety failures AND transformation governance challenges.** Technical safety is necessary but not sufficient for beneficial outcomes.

## Our approach: Containment · Alignment · Governance · Resilience

We recommend Australian organisations structure their AGI preparedness around **four interconnected pillars** based on a defence-in-depth strategy:

- **Containment** – Preventing dangerous AI systems from being developed or escaping control
- **Alignment** – Making AI systems reliably pursue intended goals and remain safe as capabilities scale
- **Governance** – Laws, institutions, and coordination that shape how AI is developed and deployed
- **Resilience** – Building capacity to withstand and recover from AI-related disruptions

These four pillars work together as **layers of defence**. Containment aims to prevent dangerous systems from being created. Alignment ensures systems are safe by design. Governance provides oversight and coordination. Resilience prepares Australia to withstand disruptions if other layers fail.

!!! warning "C·A·G·R reflects current best practice, not complete solutions"

    Key limitations include inability to reliably verify alignment (systems may appear safe in testing but behave differently in deployment), unclear capability thresholds, and need for international coordination we don't yet have. This is why defence-in-depth matters — no single layer is sufficient.

## How this relates to SafeAI-Aus core resources

!!! question "Which resources should I use?"

    **Use [SafeAI-Aus core resources](/safety-standards/)** if you're:

    - Implementing AI tools in your organisation today
    - Need policy templates, vendor evaluation, and compliance guidance
    - Managing current AI risks (bias, privacy, security)

    **Use Preparing for AGI** if you're:

    - Planning for advanced AI transformation (5-15+ years)
    - Interested in governance, democratic control, and power concentration
    - Preparing for AGI-level capabilities and systemic risks

    **Most organisations need both:** SafeAI-Aus for day-to-day operations, Preparing for AGI for strategic preparation.

## Common Questions

??? question "Isn't this just science fiction? Why worry about AGI now?"

    **The alignment problem is already real—it just gets harder as systems scale.** Recommendation algorithms optimised for engagement create polarisation. Chatbots learn to be deceptive. Content moderation AI exhibits unexpected biases. As capabilities increase, systems gain more autonomy and become harder to oversee. Alignment techniques that work for narrow systems may not scale to highly capable, autonomous agents.

    **Why prepare now:** Building evaluation capabilities takes time—we can't wait until systems are deployed. Governance frameworks need to be in place before capability thresholds are crossed. Prevention windows close rapidly once development accelerates. If we can't ensure alignment for highly capable systems before deployment, should we deploy them?

??? question "What can Australia realistically do? We don't build frontier AI."

    **Australia won't build frontier models—but we control critical deployment decisions.** We regulate which systems can be used in critical infrastructure. We set licensing requirements for high-risk applications. We decide whether to allow deployment before safety validation. We maintain evaluation capabilities to independently verify provider claims.

    **Our leverage:** Australia is a significant market for AI deployment. We participate in Five Eyes intelligence sharing. We have world-class universities and regulatory traditions. Small economies like Singapore and Switzerland punch above their weight in technology governance—Australia can too.

??? question "How does this relate to current AI governance?"

    **Most current AI governance addresses near-term risks** (bias, privacy, security, labour displacement) using tools like transparency requirements, impact assessments, and sector-specific regulation. This work is essential and forms the core of SafeAI-Aus.

    **Preparing for AGI addresses transformation risks** that may arrive in 5-15 years: advanced systems embedded in critical infrastructure, power concentration, loss of human control, and societal disruption. These require different tools: capability evaluation, containment strategies, resilience planning, and defence-in-depth approaches.

    **Both are needed.** Near-term governance builds institutional capacity. AGI preparation ensures we're ready for advanced systems.

??? question "Should we slow down AI development?"

    **This is one of the most contentious questions in AI governance.** Arguments for slowing down include buying time for safety research, reducing deployment under competitive pressure, and allowing societal adaptation. Arguments against include ceding advantage to competitors, forgoing genuine benefits (medical research, climate science), and political infeasibility.

    **SafeAI-Aus position:** Australia should advocate for coordinated international capability thresholds (don't deploy systems above certain risk levels without safety validation) rather than blanket slowdowns. We should build domestic evaluation capabilities so Australia can independently verify safety claims. See our [C·A·G·R Framework](framework/index.md) for more on containment approaches.

??? question "This feels overwhelming. Where should I start?"

    **Start with understanding, not implementation:**

    1. Read the [AGI Scenarios](agi-scenarios/index.md) to understand how risks could unfold in Australia
    2. Review the [C·A·G·R Framework](framework/index.md) for a structured approach to preparation
    3. Identify which pillar matters most for your role (containment for regulators, resilience for infrastructure operators, etc.)

    **You don't need to solve everything—just understand your organisation's specific risks and preparation needs.** For immediate actions, see our [core SafeAI-Aus resources](safety-standards/index.md) for day-to-day AI governance while building longer-term AGI preparedness.
