# Advanced AI & AGI: Preparing Australia for Transformation

> **Purpose:** Strategic guidance for preparing Australian organisations for advanced AI and potential AGI transformation
> **Audience:** Government, business leaders, and community organisations planning 5-15 year horizons | **Time:** 30-45 minutes

## What this section is for

Most AI discussion in Australia today centres on near-term adoption: productivity tools, governance frameworks, and compliance with current regulations. That work is essential and forms the core of SafeAI-Aus.

But there's a gap. What if AI systems become **far more capable** than today's tools? What happens when those systems are deeply embedded in **defence, critical infrastructure, finance, health, and media**? How should we think about **loss-of-control scenarios**, strategic misuse, and systemic shocks?

**AGI Tomorrow** addresses this gap by providing practical guidance for organisations preparing for advanced AI transformation over the next 5-15 years.

!!! info "What do we mean by AGI?"
    **AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)** refers to AI systems that match or exceed human cognitive capabilities across virtually all domains—not just narrow tasks like playing chess or recommending products, but reasoning, planning, learning, and adapting across any domain.

    **Key uncertainties:** When (or if) AGI will arrive, whether capabilities will advance gradually or discontinuously, and which capabilities emerge first. Estimates range from 5-10 years to "never."

    **Why we say "advanced AI and AGI":** We address risks that span both near-term advanced AI systems (highly capable but not human-level general intelligence) and potential longer-term AGI. The exact boundary is uncertain, but the risks require preparation now.

## Two parallel challenges: Safety AND governance

These challenges exist whether AGI is perfectly safe or catastrophically dangerous.

!!! tip "Important: Governance challenges persist even with safe AGI"
    **Even if AGI is perfectly aligned and technically safe**, Australia still faces profound challenges:

    - **Power concentration:** Who controls transformative technology? A handful of companies or nations with safe AGI still wield unprecedented influence
    - **Economic transformation:** How are productivity gains distributed? Safe AGI that automates knowledge work still transforms employment and meaning
    - **Democratic governance:** Who decides how AGI is used? Technical safety doesn't ensure democratic input or community values
    - **Resilience:** Dependencies on AI systems create vulnerability to disruption, even when systems work as intended

    **AGI Tomorrow addresses both catastrophic safety failures AND transformation governance challenges.** Technical safety is necessary but not sufficient for beneficial outcomes.

## Our approach: Containment · Alignment · Governance · Resilience

We organise Australia's response around **four interconnected pillars** based on a defence-in-depth strategy:

- **Containment** – Preventing dangerous AI systems from being developed or escaping control
- **Alignment** – Making AI systems reliably pursue intended goals and remain safe as capabilities scale
- **Governance** – Laws, institutions, and coordination that shape how AI is developed and deployed
- **Resilience** – Building capacity to withstand and recover from AI-related disruptions

These four pillars work together as **layers of defence**. Containment aims to prevent dangerous systems from being created. Alignment ensures systems are safe by design. Governance provides oversight and coordination. Resilience prepares Australia to withstand disruptions if other layers fail.

## What makes this Australian

Australia faces a distinctive risk profile: we're a small, advanced economy that imports frontier AI from the US and China but experiences full impact when those systems are deployed in our critical infrastructure.

**Key characteristics:**

- **Small population (27 million)** means less redundancy when systems fail
- **Geographic isolation** creates vulnerabilities (long supply chains) but also some resilience
- **Five Eyes partnerships** provide intelligence access and influence on allied approaches
- **Strong democratic institutions** enable accountability even for classified systems
- **Concentrated sectors** (banking, media, energy) create systemic risks
- **World-class universities** can partner on evaluation and research
- **Pragmatic culture** in technology policy supports evidence-based approaches

AGI Tomorrow asks: given this context—not the US, UK, or EU context—what should Australia do?

## How AGI Tomorrow relates to SafeAI-Aus

!!! question "Which resources should I use?"

    **Use [SafeAI-Aus core resources](/safety-standards/)** if you're:

    - Implementing AI tools in your organisation today
    - Need policy templates, vendor evaluation, and compliance guidance
    - Managing current AI risks (bias, privacy, security)

    **Use AGI Tomorrow** if you're:

    - Planning for advanced AI transformation (5-15+ years)
    - Interested in governance, democratic control, and power concentration
    - Preparing for AGI-level capabilities and systemic risks

    **Most organisations need both:** SafeAI-Aus for day-to-day operations, AGI Tomorrow for strategic preparation.

## Our principles

We aim to work in line with a few core principles:

- **Evidence-informed, robust to uncertainty** – We use the best available evidence while recognising that AGI timelines and exact threat paths are uncertain
- **Sober, not sensational** – We take systemic and existential risks seriously without hype, fear campaigns, or inevitabilist narratives
- **Public benefit and democratic accountability** – Our focus is public interest, democratic oversight, and societal resilience
- **Responsible disclosure** – We do not publish detailed technical instructions that could meaningfully increase misuse risk
- **Transparent about limitations** – We acknowledge uncertainty, mark speculative claims clearly, and update materials as evidence improves

## Next steps

**Where to go from here:**

1. **Understand the risks** – Start with [AGI Scenarios](agi-scenarios/index.md) to see concrete examples of how advanced AI risks could unfold
2. **Learn the framework** – Explore the [C·A·G·R Framework](framework/index.md) to understand defence-in-depth for AGI
3. **Take action** – Review [Sector Guidance](sector-guidance/index.md) for practical next steps in your domain
