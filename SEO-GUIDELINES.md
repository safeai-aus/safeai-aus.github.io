## Content Structure Best Practices

### 1. Heading Hierarchy
- Use H1 for the main page title (only one per page)

- Use H3 for subsections
- Use H4+ sparingly for detailed breakdowns

### 2. Keyword Optimization
- Include primary keywords in H1 and H2 headings
- Use long-tail keywords naturally throughout content
- Include related keywords and synonyms
- Avoid keyword stuffing (keep density under 2%)

### 3. Internal Linking
- Link to related pages within the site
- Use descriptive anchor text (not "click here")
- Include 3-5 internal links per page
- Create topic clusters around main themes

### 4. Content Length
- Main pages: 1,500+ words
- Template pages: 800+ words
- Resource pages: 1,000+ words
- Include practical examples and actionable content

## Image Optimization

### 1. File Names
- Use descriptive, keyword-rich names
- Use hyphens instead of spaces
- Example: `ai-readiness-checklist-template.png`

### 2. Alt Text
- Always include descriptive alt text
- Include relevant keywords naturally
- Keep under 125 characters
- Example: `alt="AI readiness checklist template for Australian businesses"`

### 3. Image Sizes

- Use appropriate dimensions for the content
- Consider adding WebP versions for modern browsers

## URL Structure

### 1. Page URLs

- Use hyphens to separate words
- Example: `/governance-templates/ai-risk-assessment-checklist/`
